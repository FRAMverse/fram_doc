# 1. Update Cycle
Galen
A new calibration of FRAM is warranted when there are changes to the input data and/or model structure. 
Examples include changes to stocks, fisheries, CWT groups, time structure, and growth, natural, and 
fishery related handling mortality rates. All of these elements influence the estimates of the cohort sizes 
calculated during cohort analysis and the corresponding estimates of exploitation rates
