# Pre-season model input development

The process for developing the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model inputs used to assess upcoming fishing season negotiations begins with the forecasting of hatchery and wild/natural stock abundances.  Fishery inputs for <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> are generally developed through the pre-season process.  Fishery-related mortality parameters, such as release mortality rates, drop-off, and mark-selective fishery parameters, are reviewed and confirmed at the start of the annual management cycle.  Many of these rates do not change from year to year, while some are the result of manager agreements made in previous years based on research study results, and some are updated annually based on monitoring data (<a target = "FRAM input data" href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_data_chin.html#2_Model_Parameterization" target = "_blank">Model input data</a>).  In the cases where research study results may be lacking, such as marked recognition error in new mark-selective fisheries, *ad hoc* values are established following technical staff discussions and manager agreement. 

## Stock abundance

A variety of methods are used to forecast abundances of coho and Chinook.  These forecasts are usually developed by local/regional technical staff during one or more technical meetings where relevant forecasting information is exchanged.  Final agreed-to forecasts are regularly published in the <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> Salmon Technical Team pre-season reports (Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation; SAFE).

Abundance forecasts vary in units of measure.  For example, there are forecasts of salmon returning to a terminal area (which implies some accounting for pre-terminal fishery levels), forecasts of ocean abundance (which is commonly fishery impacts plus escapement), and forecasts of abundances prior to any fishing impacts (which includes natural mortality and non-landed fishery related mortality).  The forecasts that are based on expectations of fish returning to the terminal area need to account for pre-terminal fishing impacts or impacts that occurred in previous seasons in the case of Chinook.  Each of these different types of forecasts need to be converted to the “unit of measure” used by <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, which is the abundance at age of each stock prior to fishing vulnerability and natural mortality. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> starting cohorts are produced by <a title = "Backwards FRAM" href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_data_chin.html#9_Backwards_FRAM" target = "_blank">BkFRAM</a>.

Although abundance forecasts vary in units of measure, the desired units for Chinook are either Terminal Run Size (TRS) or 
The process for developing the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> starting cohorts, by stock, age and mark status. TRS forecasts are defined as a forecast of the total fish ages 3-5 of a stock including escapement, freshwater mortalities, extreme terminal, and terminal net fishery mortalities.  TRS forecasts are then run through a "Backward"

Abundance of age 2 fish are either forecasted separately and provided as a model input or can be generated using an “age 2 from 3” feature in <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> (see <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/user_prereq.html" target = "_blank">FRAM User Manual</a>).
