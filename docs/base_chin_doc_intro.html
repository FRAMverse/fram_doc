<h1>1. Introduction test</h1>
<p>The Chinook base period consists of foundational Fishery Regulation
Assessment Model (FRAM) data. The most important parameter, base period
exploitation rates, is estimated from “base years” through
stock-specific
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Coded-Wire_Tag_(CWT)" target = "_blank" title = "CWT">CWT</a>
recovery analysis and a process of <a href="#CR">cohort
reconstruction</a>. Base period data represent all the static
information that has been averaged over a range of catch years.
Resulting base period reference parameters are used to populate the FRAM
model to predict annual stock/fishery specific impacts.</p>
<p>Fishing years 2007-2013 were chosen as base years, because they
reflected the most contemporary period at the time the project commenced
and additionally had good numbers of CWT recoveries from recently
implemented
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Mark-Selective_Fishery_(MSF)" target = "_blank" title = "Mark-Selective">mark-selective</a>
sport fisheries.</p>
<p>The process of creating the latest base period is also called the
“2014 Calibration Process”. The calibration followed the existing data
structure of 38 stocks (Table @ref(tab:Stocks)) (<a href="#M">adipose
marked only</a>), 73 fisheries (Table @ref(tab:Fish)), and 3
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_data_chin.html#13_Time_Steps" target = "_blank" title = "Chinook Time-Steps">time-steps</a>
(Table @ref(tab:TimeSteps)).</p>
<p>In addition to CWT recovery data representing FRAM stocks, other key
data needed for the development of the FRAM base period include: 1)
escapements, 2) landed catch, 3) growth rates, and 4) fishery induced
mortality rates. For a complete set of input data, see the section on
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/base_chin_doc_data.html" target = "_blank" title = "Chinook Time-Steps">data
inputs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Overview</h1>
<p>The main objective of a calibration is to estimate stock-fishery
specific exploitation rates by averaging CWT recoveries over base period
years and conducting a cohort analysis. Exploitation rates are estimated
by
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_data_chin.html#13_Time_Steps" target = "_blank" title = "Chinook Time-Steps">time-step</a>
and age. A cohort and exploitation rate analysis necessitates full
accounting of <strong>all fishery related mortality</strong> along a
stock’s migration path. While the basic processes for a cohort
reconstruction are quite simple, much of the work of constructing a new
base period lies in data preparation, dealing with missing
coded-wire-tag recoveries, handling exceptions, adjusting CWT recoveries
to match observed catches, and incorporating non-landed mortalities.</p>
<p>A simple diagram of the calibration process is presented in Figure
@ref(fig:cal-plot). This program flow works for all stocks with
sufficient CWT representation in base period years (37 of the 38 FRAM
stocks). For a description of how to handle CWT recoveries from
“out-of-base” years see
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Out-of-Base_(OOB)" target = "_blank" title = "Out-of-base">out-of-base
procedures</a>.</p>

<p>These steps will be described in detail in section
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/base_chin_doc_calibration.html" target = "_blank" title = "Calibration Procedures">Calibration
procedures</a></p>
<p>The final step in the calibration cycle is the development of a
completed “base period” input file used by FRAM. This file contains
stock abundances, time-age-fishery specific harvest rates, maturation
rates, growth rates, and various fishery related parameters such as
hooking mortality rates covering the base period fishing years.</p>
</div>
<div id="preparation" class="section level1">
<h1>3. Preparation</h1>
<p>Much effort went into planning the new Chinook base period in an
environment with many stakeholders and new challenges.The original base
period was over 30 years old with sparse documentation, lost
institutional knowledge, and defunct and fragmented computer programs.
During the initial phase, a team of expert discussed how to conduct base
period outreach and review, evaluate CWT sample sizes, address
challenges due to mark-selective fisheries, outdated programs, missing
CWT representation, and much more.</p>
<div id="assemble-team-of-experts-and-stakeholders"
class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 Assemble Team of Experts and Stakeholders</h2>
<p>FRAM is used in several forums, such as the Pacific Fishery
Management Council
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Pacific_Fishery_Management_Council_(PFMC)" target="_blank">PFMC</a>
and the Puget Sound co-manager process, by many different user groups
from federal, state, and tribal organisations. Updates and changes to
FRAM can have wide-ranging consequences and affect escapement estimates
and management objectives for model stocks, many of them protected under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA). FRAM changes, especially major
modification, necessitate extensive buy-in and review and in some cases
review by PFMC’s methodology review process. During the initial phase, a
team of experts and stakeholders representing tribal, state, and federal
entities was assembled. A base period work group was established that
met at least monthly. The workgroup consisted of the following
members:</p>

<li>Auerbach, Dan (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW),
lead Coho modeler)</li>
<li>Bellman, Marlene (Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC),

<h2>3.2 Mass Marking and Mark-Selective Fisheries</h2>
<p>Development of exploitation rates relies on the recovery of
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Coded-Wire_Tag_(CWT)" target = "_blank" title = "CWT">coded
wire tags</a>. Coded micro-wire is implanted in the snout of juvenile
salmon prior to release. When recovered, the binary or numeric code on
the tag identifies the tag group, and thus provides information about
the location and timing of release, special hatchery treatments, etc.
This information is used to assign CWT recoveries to individual stocks.
Prior to
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Mass_Marking" target = "_blank" title = "Mass Marking">
mass marking </a> a missing adipose fin was a visual indicator that a
salmon contained a CWT. A sampler could then remove the snout and send
it to the lab for extraction and analysis of the CWT. With mass-marking,
this visual indicator was re-purposed as an identifier of a hatchery
salmon. Having a method to distinguish hatchery from wild salmon ushered
in an era of mark selective (MSF) fisheries, where anglers are required
to identify (intact adipose fin) and release wild salmon. Unmarked
Chinook are sporadically tagged as control groups, acting as surrogates
for wild fish, to assess impacts of mark selective fisheries and mass
marking (double index tag groups).</p>
<p>While Washington State switched to electronic CWT detection by
trained samplers a few years before full implementation of mass marking,
some States and Canada were slow to adopt the new technology. Today,
there are still several fisheries along the migration path of Washington
native Chinook that are solely visually sampled. This results in not
detecting CWT’s of adipose present (unmarked) salmon and thus biases
exploitation rate analyses of unmarked Chinook. Additionally, even with
electronic sampling, the recovery of CWT’s from unmarked fish is biased,
because they are no longer retained in mark-selective fisheries. For
these reasons, similar to the previous Chinook base period, it was
decided to limit CWTs to recoveries from adipose marked salmon.
Therefore, marked Chinook represent both marked and unmarked components
of the same stock in both base periods.</p>
<p>In developing the previous base period, CWT recoveries were related
to total catches and total escapements to compute exploitation rates
(“Total” frame of reference). Due to the influence of mark-selective
fisheries in recent years, the new base period relates CWT recoveries to
marked catches and marked escapement only (“Marked” frame of reference).
The latter data manipulation allows for calibration under contemporary
fishery conditions using the same calibration algorithms and procedures
that have been used in the past; it simply views everything as a
non-selective fishery (NSF) in a world populated by marked fish only.
Doing otherwise (i.e., using total catches in mark-selective fisheries),
would necessitate time consuming changes to calibration algorithms and
infrastructure (i.e., databases, pre-processing programs/files) in order
to relate recoveries to encounters rather than landed catches and to
incorporate mark-selective fishing parameters.</p>
<p>Beyond calibration logistics, the “marked” frame of reference is
preferable for other reasons. First, given the existence of a mix of
non-selective and
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Mark-Selective_Fishery_(MSF)" target = "_blank" title = "Mark-Selective">mark-selective</a>
regulations, the “marked” approach will yield cohort reconstructions
results with less bias than the “total” approach. Second, even with full
electronic sampling, sufficient DIT groups, and a means to integrate
them into calibration, a “total” calibration would necessarily yield a
base period built on specific MSF parameter assumptions (i.e., release
mortality rates); these may or may not be consistent with future FRAM
applications. Lastly, the inputs to a “marked” calibration are likely to
have more certainty associated with them than those for a “total”
calibration for more information also see <a href="#xxx">“Develop the
new Base Period Using Marked Landed Catches and Escapements versus Total
Landed Catches and Escapements.docx”</a>). Consider, for example,
hatchery and wild escapement estimates—the former is often a census
whereas the latter is an estimate with considerable imprecision and
(possibly) bias.</p>
<p>Despite its merits, the “marked” calibration approach introduces its
own challenges. Most significantly, upon creation, a “marked” base
period must be translated into something that can be applied on a
“total” basis. Although this is straightforward for exploitation rates
(i.e., ER for marked stocks become exploitation rates or encounter rates
for unmarked stocks in NSF and MSF, respectively), “total” applications
also require an estimate of

stock proportion (MSP)</a>. MSP is the expected fraction of a fishery’s
total catch that is comprised of model stocks. For these reasons, the
calibration was performed on “marked only” catch and escapement values
for the purpose of calculating exploitation rates and on “total” catch
and escapement values for the purpose of calculating MSP.</p>

<h2>3.4 Updating Computer Programs</h2>
<p>A major task of the new base period project was to create an
efficient, easy-to-use programs for base period development and CWT
processing. The original base period necessitated approximately a dozen
programs. These programs were written in QBasic. The file editing
process was prone to transcription errors and the formats of the various
input files were undocumented and typically contained several disjointed
sections where parameter values had to be entered. In many cases the
output from one program was used to create the input file for the next
program in the estimation process. Any data or selection changes usually
resulted in re-running of all components of the system.</p>
<p>There are now just two programs to create a base period. Both
programs are written in Visual Basic and interact with Microsoft Access
databases for data storage and retrieval. The first program,
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/base_chin_doc_program_desc.html#12_FRAM_Builder" target = "_blank" title = "FRAM Builder">FRAM

tags to stocks and fisheries, and summarized CWT data for the

reconstructions, calculates base period exploitation rates, produces all
parameters for a new base period, and exports output directly into the
FRAM database structure.</p>
<p>Both programs are described in detail in later sections of this
documentation.</p>

<h2>3.5 Base Period Years</h2>
<p>The Chinook FRAM base period project began in 2014 with the
investigation of the feasibility of developing a dataset based on the
analysis of coded-wire tag (CWT) recoveries from recent year releases of
tag groups. The previous base dataset was derived from CWT recoveries
and stock and fishery information from the late 1970s to the early
1980s. Significant changes have occurred in stock abundances, fishing
seasons, and fishery structure since this time frame which have
necessitated several ad-hoc modifications to FRAM (and/or its inputs) to
keep pace. Brood years 2005 through 2008 contributing to 2007-2013
fisheries were selected as the time period most appropriate for
developing a contemporary base dataset. For Central Valley Falls, brood
years 2007-2009 were chosen, because of extensive fishery closures
affecting this stock during 2008-2009 fishing years. During initial
feasibility assessments where CWTs by stock and fishery were enumerated,
these brood years had a sufficient number of CWT recoveries on par with
the previous base period for many stocks and fisheries. Additionally,
many Puget Sound sport fisheries had recently re-opened under
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Mark-Selective_Fishery_(MSF)" target = "_blank" title = "Mark-Selective">mark-selective</a>
regulation, providing a valuable source of CWT recoveries.</p>

<h2>3.6 Stock and Fishery Profiles</h2>
<p>For each FRAM stock and fishery, metadata are recorded on the
associated information used in the calibration process. These stock and
fishery profiles are in spreadsheet form and become the basis for
documentation of the data and sources for the data in the calibration.
Data included, but not limited to, are list of tag codes for each stock,
stock abundance estimates in the river return, landed catch and size

<h3>Surrogate Fisheries</h3>
<div id="background" class="section level4">
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Surrogate fisheries are used for fisheries with insufficient CWT
recoveries. Some base period fisheries had few or no recoveries because
of closures or small landed catches, poor sampling, or low tagging
rates. Even for fisheries that are unlikely to allow retention, base
period exploitation rates may still be needed to estimate non-retention
impacts. For these fisheries (recipient fisheries), an evaluation was
conducted to determine whether other fisheries or time steps could stand
in as surrogates; i.e. using CWT recoveries from the surrogate
fishery/time step to represent the recipient fishery.</p>
</div>
<div id="determine-recipient-fishery-and-surrogates"
class="section level4">
<h4>Determine Recipient Fishery and Surrogates</h4>
<p>Raw CWT recoveries from base period years were summed over fisheries
and time steps. If a fishery had a recovery during a closed period, the
recovery was added to the nearest open time step.</p>
<p>As a general rule, if a fishery or time step had fewer than 20
recoveries, it was evaluated for suitable surrogates. An exception to
this rule was made for the Grays Harbor net fishery because there were
no appropriate surrogates and the stock composition resulting from the 7
recoveries looked plausible.</p>
<p>CWT recoveries from Puget Sound net fisheries, with the exception of
Bellingham Bay, are automatically combined by FRAMbuilder, because
non-treaty net fisheries are usually too small to provide a significant
number of CWT recoveries. Additionally, coding in the Regional Mark
Processing System (RMIS) often does not allow a differentiation between
treaty and non-treaty tag recoveries. For the purpose of the cohort
reconstruction each fishery of a treaty/non-treaty pair is modeled at
50% of the combined catch. CWT recoveries are adjusted to produce the
combined catch. Unlike the previous base period that only allowed for
whole-sale replacement of one fishery with another fishery, even if some
of the time steps had sufficient recoveries, the new calibration
programs have been adapted to allow a more flexible approach. Surrogate
fisheries were assigned using the best judgement and expertise of a
group of experts. For fisheries without obvious surrogates, the group
compared the stock composition from the tags on hand (if any) with the
current base period before making a final determination. Generally,
assignments occurred in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the same fishery, but a different time step; i. e. Bellingham
Bay net time 3 for Bellingham Bay net time 1. Time steps 2 (May-June) or
3 (Jul- Sep) were used as a surrogate for each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a fishery in the same area and time step; i.e. Area 9 sport
for Area 9 net.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine several fisheries or time steps rather than replacing
CWTs from one fishery with CWTs from another fishery; Central Oregon
Sport time 1 (9 recoveries) and time 3 (103 recoveries) were combined
for a total of 112 recoveries to represent both time steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Use base period exploitation rates (BPER) from the current base
period to impute CWT recoveries for the new base period; i.e. WCVI net.
This fishery had only 3 recoveries in the new base period. WCVI sport
was deemed unsuitable as a surrogate, because the net fishery is located
much more terminally than the sport fishery. Instead, the current base
period stock composition based on 175 recoveries (time 2) was used as a
surrogate (see methods under paragraph
<a href="#surrogate-methods">“Surrogate Methods”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Use out-of-base fishery method (OOBER) to obtain exploitation
rates to impute CWT recoveries for the new base period. This method is
similar to the method described above, but develops exploitation rates
from brood years that are neither part of the current nor the new base
period (see Appendix C); i.e. South Puget Sound net (A13A net). There
are too few recoveries in the new base period for this fishery. Base
period exploitation rates from the current base period produce a Hood
Canal fall fingerling impact that has been deemed too high during
previous investigations. Instead a suite of recent brood years with
adequate sampling was selected to represent exploitation rate patterns
for this fishery.</p></li>

<div id="surrogate-methods" class="section level4">
<h4>Surrogate Methods</h4>
<p>For documentation and replicability purposes all surrogate fisheries
are processed in module “ImputeRecov” of the “MainCalibration” program.
Instruction for surrogate fisheries are located in table
“ImputeRecoveries” of the “CalibrationSupport” database (Table
@ref(tab:CWTSurrogate)). The “Type” column of the “ImputeRecoveries”
table specifies the method, whereas the columns “RecipientFishery” and
“RecipientTimeStep” specify the fishery number and time step receiving
CWT information from a surrogate (donor) fishery (column
“SurrogateFishery”) and surrogate time step (column
“SurrogateTimeStep”). Unless otherwise specified CWTs from the recipient
fishery and time step are replaced with CWTs from the surrogate fishery
and time step and divided by 1000. This results in a recipient fishery
with an identical stock composition as the surrogate fishery but only
1/1000 of the CWT catch of the surrogate.</p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:surrogate)</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
CWT_{s, a, RecipientFishery, RecipientTimeStep} = \frac{CWT_{s, a,
SurrogateFishery, SurrogateTimeStep} }{1000} (\#eq:surrogate)
$$</span></p>
<p>The original intent of this division was to keep the recipient catch
small under the assumption that a lack of sufficient CWT recoveries is
due to small catches. This provides a fishery with a stock composition
for modeling, while minimally influencing the cohort reconstruction. For
out of base runs (OOB) the recipient fishery is not re-adjusted and
hence stays at the low value, for the “All Stocks” run CWTs from the
recipient fishery are later adjusted so that the CWT catch matches the
estimated catch in the fishery. This produces a model stock proportion
of 100% for all recipient fisheries. For this calibration, algorithms
were further adjusted to allow the incorporation of an external model
stock proportion (see paragraph <a href="#SurrogateMSP">“Surrogate
Fisheries and Model Stock Proportion”</a>). The following surrogate
methods are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Type 0:</strong> This is currently the only method for
out-of-base stocks. It results in the replacement of the recipient
fishery and time step with the surrogate fishery and time step and uses
the divide by 1000 equation to scale recoveries (equation
@ref(eq:surrogate)).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type 1:</strong> Combines recoveries for a fishery from
different time steps and/or fisheries. The surrogate fishery and/or time
step is deleted. Recipient CWTs are not divided by 1000. This method is
commonly used to edit CWT recoveries in cases where recoveries were
reported in the wrong time step. These recoveries are added to the
correct time step and zeroed out in the incorrect time step. This method
is also used to combine recoveries from multiple fisheries and time step
to gain an adequate number of recoveries for analysis; i.e. deep SPS
(Area 13+) net and sport.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type 2:</strong> This is the same method as ‘Type 0’, but
used for CWTs in the base period. Allows for replacement of a fishery
and time step with another time step and/or fishery and uses the divide
by 1000 equation to scale recoveries (equation @ref(eq:surrogate)).
Zeroes out the original fishery/time step. This method is used for most
fisheries and conforms to the standard surrogate fishery replacement
concept.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type 3:</strong> This method eliminates a fishery and
time step <span
class="math display"><em>C</em><em>W</em><em>T</em><sub><em>s</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>R</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>i</em><em>p</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>F</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>y</em>, <em>R</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>i</em><em>p</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>T</em><em>i</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>S</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>p</em></sub> = 0</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type 9:</strong> This method uses base period
exploitation rates from the previous calibration or the out-of-base
fishery method (Table @ref(tab:CWTSurrogate)) to impute CWT recoveries
for the recipient fishery. These base period exploitation rates are
stored in table “SurrogateFishBPER” (Table @ref(tab:SurrogateBPER)) of
the “CalibrationSupport” database. The “ImputeRecoveries” table
designates the surrogate fishery and time step for use of base period
exploitation rates. The base period exploitation rates are applied to
the legal cohort sizes of the exploited stocks in the fishery. For Type
9 the following equations are applied: Equation @ref(eq:Type91) For a
recipient fishery and time step the imputed CWT recoveries are summed
over stocks and ages to compute the CWTCatch. Equation @ref(eq:Type92)
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="surrogate-fisheries-and-model-stock-proportions"
class="section level4">
<h4>Surrogate Fisheries and Model Stock Proportions</h4>
<p>In the previous base period, CWT recoveries for recipient fisheries
were either set to very small values (divide by 1000 in the out-of-base
run) or adjusted to match base period catch (‘All-Stocks-Run’). As long
as recipient fisheries were small, this resulted in a small error. Some
recipient fisheries are quite large and have significant non-model stock
proportions. In the new calibration program, the user has the option of
externally assigning non-model stock proportions for these
fisheries.<br />
Handling of CWTCatch is described in paragraph <a href="#MSPpn">Fishery
Model Stock Proportion</a> and specified in tables ‘BasePeriodCatch’
(Table @ref(tab:MrkCatch)) for marked and ‘BasePeriodCatch_Tot’ (Table
@ref(tab:TotalCatch)) for marked plus unmarked.</p>
</div>
<div id="out-of-base-fishery-method" class="section level4">
<h4>Out-of-Base Fishery Method</h4>
<p>The Out-of-Base Fishery Method is used for fisheries where none of
the previously discussed approaches are feasible; i.e. no suitable
surrogates in the new base period, problematic exploitation rates in the
prior base period, etc. South Puget Sound (Area 13) sport and net
fisheries have very few CWT recoveries in base period years due to
sporadic sampling and tagging. This method develops exploitation rates
for select fisheries from brood years that differ from base period years
using the following steps: 1. Select brood years with an adequate number
of CWT recoveries. See xxx“SouthSoundSurrogateTagWorkup.xlsx” for more
information.<br> 2. Identify FRAM stock aggregates contributing to the
recoveries from step 1. Marked recoveries were used for all stocks
except White River Yearlings, because this stock was not marked. <br> 3.
Select tag groups for brood years and stocks identified.<br> 4. Impute
missing freshwater sport recoveries.<br> 5. Summarizes CWTs with
FRAMbuilder (manual summary for White Yearlings) and import into main
calibration database table “CWTforSPS_SurrogateMethod” (Table
@ref(tab:CWTSPS)). <br> 6. Run recoveries from main calibration database
table “CWTforSPS_SurrogateMethod”. Select run option for “Cohort
Reconstruction w/o Expansions”. This produces a cohort reconstruction
without escapement expansions (production expansion factors) , fishery
expansions, incidental mortalities (routines not set up for single stock
runs), and surrogate fishery methods (not needed for this method).<br>
7. Paste exploitation rates produced during previous step for selected
fisheries and time steps into table “SurrogateFishBPER” (Table
@ref(tab:SurrogateBPER)) 8. Set flagging in table “ImputeRecoveries”
(Table @ref(tab:CWTSurrogate)) to “Type 9”. xxx how are these BPERs
turned into CWTs? What about the BPER method using previous base
period</p>

<p>Sinclair Inlet fisheries encounter predominantly Gorst Creek hatchery
Chinook. This stock is part of the the mid-Puget Sound (MPS) stock
aggregate. Gorst Creek fish were not tagged during the base period,
