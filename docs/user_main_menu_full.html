<h1>Main menu screen</h1>
<p>After launching <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> and continuing past the startup splash screen, the main menu organizes the available functionality. Below are links to sections that correspond to different main menu items as well as descriptions of some of the primary files associated with preparing and conducting runs.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_main_menu.png" width="100%" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Database</strong> is the first step to using <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, opening a file selection window to choose a [Project database]</li>

<li><strong>Select Model Run</strong> allows the choice of a particular model run and associated parameters from the [Project database];<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><strong><span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> <a href="#utilities">Utilities</a></strong> opens a secondary menu of tools for managing files and runs</li>

<li><strong>Output/Results</strong> opens a secondary menu allowing selection of various [Outputs] following model run completion</li>
<li><strong>Exit</strong> closes the program</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="edit-model-run" class="section level1">
<h1>Edit model run</h1>
<p><span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> allows users to explore different management scenarios by adjusting “inputs” ([Per-run parameters]) that control fishery and stock properties.</p>
<p>For some analyses, it may make sense to adjust model parameters outside of the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> application. For example, a uniform increase or decrease in a group of fisheries over multiple time steps may be accomplished more easily by manipulating the project database directly.</p>
<p>However, the main menu “Edit model run” button accesses a convenient interface for changing individual values within the application. Clicking this produces a submenu divided into further “Stock” and “Fishery” buttons.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_edit.png" width="100%" /></p>
<div id="stock-recruits" class="section level2">
<h2>Stock recruits</h2>
<p>Stock recruit scalers (<code>StockRecruit</code> in [Per-run parameters]) are multiplied against a base period abundance (<code>BaseCohort</code> in [Base period parameters]) to generate a starting, pre-fishing cohort by stock (and age for Chinook).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>These parameters represent the magnitude of the current stock abundance relative to that during the base period years. Thus, a stock recruit scaler of 1 indicates an annual abundance for that stock equal to the base period, a value &gt;1 is an abundance larger than the base period, and &lt;1 is an abundance smaller than the base period.</p>
<p>Coho ‘Recruit Cohort’ values are in January age-3 units, whereas Chinook ‘Recruit Cohort’ contains four age-class specific initial ocean abundance values.</p>
<p>For preseason forward runs, stock recruit scaler values are a function of stock-specific forecasts provided by technical staff at the beginning of the planning cycle. They are generally established at the outset of preseason planning and then updated if necessary as additional data are available for the year (i.e. Canadian Chinook forecasts are not usually available until the end of March). For Chinook, stock recruit scalers are typically produced from terminal run size forecasts by running <a href="#backwards-fram">Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span></a>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, recruit scalers would not usually be manually adjusted during a typical forward model run, but the interface enables this possibility if, for example, one wanted to explore the implications of a much larger or smaller salmon return than was predicted or with a different age distribution (e.g., “what happens if stock X returns at half of what was forecast and/or with far more younger fish?”).</p>
<p>Note that updating the stock recruit scaler will automatically update the associated recruit cohort and vice versa.</p>
<p>The “Read Recruits” button can be used to load forecast values compiled in the external FRAMVSTemplate file from sheet FRAM_Recruits. Conversely, the “Fill Spreadsheet” button can be used to download values from the model run to the FRAMVSTemplate file, where additional notation or comments can be stored.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_edit_stock_recruit.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="stockfishery-scalers" class="section level2">
<h2>Stock/Fishery Scalers</h2>
<p>Stock-fishery-specific exploitation rate (<span title="ER: Exploitation rate">ER</span>) scalers allow adjustments to the base period directed impacts of a particular fishery on a specific stock or group of stocks within each time step. These scalers function act on the base period fishery-stock-specific <span title="ER: Exploitation rate">ERs</span>.</p>
<p>These parameters can provide a temporary fix to an identified issue in the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> base period calibration. They are also used to represent negotiated closures within a fishery (e.g. a spatial closure). Any such adjustments must be supported by an accepted external analysis of fishery-stock interactions which demonstrates how and why the fishery would be expected to have different stock-specific contribution levels than it had during the base period years (e.g. <span title="CWT:Coded-wire tag">CWT</span> recoveries or genetic stock identification).</p>
<p>Stock-fishery-specific <span title="ER: Exploitation rate">ER</span> scalers display 0 until a fishery is selected from the upper left drop-down menu.</p>
<p>If a fishery/time-step is not modeled, a “****” is displayed with blue highlight.</p>
<p>By default, the values are equal to 1, which means the base period exploitation rate is used. Thus, a value &gt;1 is a larger <span title="ER:Exploitation rate">ER</span> than the base period and &lt;1 is smaller than the base period <span title="ER: Exploitation rate">ER</span>.</p>
<p>After choosing the focal fishery, the desired values are directly input into each cell and the “Ok - Done” button writes those changes to the project database for the active model run. These changes then persist across subsequently copied runs.</p>
<p>Few to none of these scalers may be “actively” modifying the many possible stock-fishery combinations in a <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run, and the red “Show Active Scalers” button presents a secondary screen filtered to and highlighting those particular instances. Although values cannot be directly modified on this screen, it can serve as a useful check of the current model run parameterization.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="fishery-quotascalers" class="section level2">
<h2>Fishery Quota/Scalers</h2>
<p>These [Per-run parameters] control the representation of fishery effort and may be the most frequently adjusted <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> element during preseason planning.</p>
<p>As noted in the [Edit input parameter values] section of [A Basic Forward Run], legal, landed catch fishery impacts are controlled by “quotas” and/or “scalers” which are in turn controlled by per-timestep <code>fishery flags</code>. Values entered or adjusted under the quota/scalers input menus are stored in the [Project database tables] <code>FisheryScalers</code>. Fisheries without an input will be modeled with a default fishery effort scaler of 0.0 (flag = 1).</p>
<p>The flag values (displayed in the interface) determine whether the fishery is treated as non-selective and/or mark selective, and whether catch is processed as a fixed expectation (quotas) or as effort relative to the base period (scalers). Both modes operate on the fishery as a whole, combining with stock and age specific exploitation rates to determine resulting impacts from the fishery.</p>
<p>Note that many fishery/time-step cells are filled with asterisks (****) designating a lack of base period information to model that stratum. If a fishery now operates in one of those time steps the input (and impacts) need to be combined with an adjacent fishery or time step.</p>
<p>A single value in the input interface (either a scaler or quota) can be entered, and once the model is run, the resulting associated value will be populated in the interface (e.g. enter a quota value here and proceed through the menus to complete a model run, which will then return the resulting scaler value for that entered quota). Several values can be entered or updated before clicking “OK – Done”.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/fvs_edit_fish_quotascaler.png" alt="Fishery flag effects are shown below the current scaler and quota values." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Fishery flag effects are shown below the current scaler and quota values.
</p>
</div>
<p>The values for mark-selective fisheries are displayed on a secondary input screen that is displayed after selecting “Ok - done”. Only fishery and time steps flagged in the first fishery controls screen as mark-selective or a combination with a mark-selective component will be present in the secondary <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> input screen (flags 7, 8, 17, 18, 27,28; displaying a magenta highlight in Scaler/Quota cells). <strong>Thus, if you want to enter a <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> or change a <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> input parameter, be sure it is flagged as such first.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to scaler and quota inputs, the <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> fishery controls input screen also contains four additional input parameters. Some of these parameters are derived and agreed-to each preseason planning cycle by salmon co-managers and others are set by the <span title="PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> management process. Thus, some stay fairly static year-to-year and some change annually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release Rate: Hooking release mortality rate (landed fish then released)</li>
<li>Marked MisID: Release rate of marked fish that could be legally retained</li>
<li>UnMark MisID: Retention rate of unmarked fish that should have been released</li>
<li>DropOff Rate: Fishery-related mortality rate (fish that escape but die due to injury)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note these four <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> input parameters cannot have a zero value and must be &gt;0.0000.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/fvs_edit_fish_quotascaler_msf.png" alt="Mark-selective values are displayed on a second interface after approving non-selective values." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>Altering a fishery <code>quota</code> has fairly intuitive implications (though the target value may itself result from considerable additional calculation external to <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>). In contrast, the particular numeric effects of altering <code>fishery scalers</code> requires more prior knowledge of the base period practices (and stock composition).</p>
<p>In addition to the direct adjustment of single values in the interface (which are then written to the database), the “Import catch” and “Export to spreadsheet” buttons provide functionality to read and write values for all fisheries and time steps at once from an external [FRAMVSTemplate file], on sheets FRAMinput and FRAM_MSF. Note also the “clipboard copy” option in the upper left corner of the interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-retention" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-Retention</h2>
<p>Coho or Chinook non-retention (<span title="CNR: Chinook non-retention">CNR</span>) inputs represent any fishery (or portion of a fishery) that will be open for salmon fishing but requires release of Coho or Chinook. Differences in the input menu screens for Coho and Chinook reflect the different methodologies.</p>
<p>For Chinook, similar to other inputs, control flag values (flags 1 – 4) determine the mode by which non-retention impacts are calculated, with different modes requiring various additional parameter values (Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4) (definitions displayed in the lower left of the interface window). Typically, only flag 3 (Legal/Sublegal Encounters) or flag 4 (Total Encounters) are used. Encounters for Puget Sound marine sport fisheries can be automatically updated using the [Automate Pass 1 Pass 2] button on the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> <a href="#utilities">Utilities</a> menu.</p>
<p>For Coho, non-retention mortality is calculated outside of the model and entered as the total number of dead fish resulting from the non-retention portion of a fishery/time-step. Typically, the value is derived from a historic level of landed or encountered coho and then applying both a release mortality rate and a drop-off mortality rate to that historic level, and summing the two types of mortalities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the individual values can be altered (and consequently saved to the run in the database) and there is also a button to “Zero All Fields”. In addition, the interface provides options to “Import NonRetention” and “Export to Spreadsheet” all fishery/time steps from the external FRAMVSTemplate file (sheet FRAM_CNR).</p>
<p>Note many fishery/time-step cells are filled with asterisks (****) designating a lack of base period information to model that stratum. If a fishery now operates in one of those time steps the input (and impacts) need to be combined with an adjacent fishery or time step.</p>

<p>The minimum length of legal landed catch is defined per-fishery and time-step. This is relevant for multi-aged Chinook modeling where the minimum retention size limit (unit = fork length in millimeters) may vary annually, by fishery and/or by time-step. Generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>troll fisheries often require larger fish than sport in the same location and time</li>
<li>winter limits are often smaller</li>

<h1>Save Model Run Inputs</h1>
<p>Model input parameters are saved in memory within the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> interface when values are entered or updated from any “Edit Model Run” submenu.</p>
<p>Once the user has modified stock or fishery inputs from the main input menu and clicked the “Exit” button to return to the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Main Menu, the “Save Model Run Inputs” button should be selected. This step writes the working set of input parameters to each of the appropriate project database tables for the model run.</p>
<p>If you select the button, a message “No input values have changed. No action taken.” may appear if there have been no changes made.</p>
<p>However, if changes have been made but are only currently in memory, then several options will appear: “Replace Current Model Run” or “Save NEW Model Run”, and a “Cancel Save” button to return to the Main Menu.</p>
<p>If the “Replace Current Model Run” is selected, then any changes will overwrite the values in the project database for the model run shown at the bottom of the application window. Upon completion, the program will return to the Main Menu with the same model run name.</p>
<p>If the “Save NEW Model Run” button is selected, then the program will display the <a href="#copy-model-run">Copy model run</a> screen to allow entry of a new run name, run title, run year, comments on changes, etc. This process will generate a separate model run in the project database that includes the model input changes. By default, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> will name a new model run “COPY OF ……” the currently selected model run name. After clicking “OK – Done”, the program will complete the database write and return to the Main Menu with the new model run selected.</p>

<h1>Run Model</h1>
<p>This menu item initiates a model run - applying the current parameters and input values to produce new output values.</p>
<p>The application monitors when a user may have altered values relative to the currently loaded run. If “Run Model” is selected when input values have changed but have not yet been saved to the project database tables associated with the model run, then a pop-up window will prompt with the message “Input Values Have Been Changed! Changes Must be Saved before Running Model!!! Save Current Model Run???”.</p>
<p>If you select “Yes” and save your model inputs by replacing the current model run or creating a new model run, then when you click “Run Model” from the Main Menu, it will present the Model Run Specifications menu.</p>
<p>If you select the “No”, a message will warn you “Please be aware that the OUTPUT for this model run cannot be duplicated without saving your INPUT values.” If you click “OK”, then it will present the Model Run Specifications menu.</p>
<p>The forwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Model Run Specifications menu screens include several optional checkboxes which differ by species. The sections below describe these in more detail.</p>
<p>The “Select <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>” button is used to navigate to and select an associated <a href="#tamm"><span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span></a> file (see also <a href="#running-fram-with-tamm">Running <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> with <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span></a>). Note that when a model run with a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> begins, the prompt “Do you want to save <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> Transfer Values into <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> spreadsheet?” will apear. Choosing “Yes” will ensure <a href="#tamx">TAMX</a> values are updated. After run completion, the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file used will include updated values and be open, though possibly in the background. <strong>Make sure to navigate to the open <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file and save it to retain the modeled values.</strong></p>
<p>Once the model run is complete, the model run name may have been updated with a prefix in the list of model runs within a database (Main Menu – Select Model Run to see list). For coho, the prefix “bc-“ is added when the default calculations for MSF bias correction have been used in a model run. For Chinook, the prefix “SLC-“ is added when the default calculations for size limit fix have been used in a model run.</p>

<h3>Run coastal iterations</h3>
<p>Beginning with the 2017 preseason, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> was updated to automate a previously manual process of iterating Washington coastal terminal fishery inputs between <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> and <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. The fishery inputs are read into <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> from a formatted table on <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> sheet WACoastTerminal (starting row 150, cells in green highlight, as landed catch; flag 2 = fishery quota) and iterated to ± 1 fish.</p>
<p>When working with a Coho project database, from the main menu “Run Model” button, the Model Run Specifications screen requires you to select the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file associated with the model run and then select the checkbox for “Run Coastal Iterations” before clicking the “RUN Model” button to complete the process.</p>
<p>By default, this checkbox should be used/checked with all preseason Coho model runs, as Washington coastal iterations are needed every time a terminal area’s fishery structure changes or when a pre-terminal <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fishery changes the ocean escapement value.</p>
<p>In general, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> produces an ocean escapement for each Washington coastal coho stock and regional technical staff utilize those values in regional terminal harvest management models. The local stock-specific harvest rates from the regional terminal models are then utilized in the WACoastTerminal sheet of the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> and in subsequent calculations. These results differ from the base period exploitation rates used in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>.<br />
However, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is used with base period stock composition for associated impacts upon non-local stocks in terminal regional fisheries with “dip-ins” (i.e. fish which could be expected to return to their native systems if not harvested; not a stray).</p>
<p>Thus, the final results of stock impacts in Washington coastal terminal fisheries are a combination of regional specific local stock impacts and those produced by the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> and its base period.</p>
</div>
<div id="run-without-msf-bias-correction" class="section level3">
<h3>Run without <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> bias correction</h3>
<p>By default, a mark-selective fishery bias correction factor is used in both preseason and post-season Coho <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> modeling. The <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> bias correction in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> was a result of demonstrating that unmarked mortalities were underestimated due to multiple encounter bias from mark-selective fisheries <span class="citation">[@conrad2010]</span> and the desire to incorporate bias-corrected equations into <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> <span class="citation">[@conrad2011, @ahb2012]</span>.</p>
<p>The checkbox “Run w/o <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> Bias Correction” should not be checked except in unusual circumstances or for troubleshooting purposes. As a result of the <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> bias correction factor calculations in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, the program will often prompt the user with a warning that a particular stock has exceeded 100% <span title="ER: Exploitation rate">ER</span> (i.e. the stock size has gone negative in the model and at what point). This is often helpful in troubleshooting issues with fishery inputs.</p>

<h3>Chinook Brood Year <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> Report</h3>
<p>Selecting this check box produces a brood year exploitation rate report called “BY-Cohort-Compare-FramVS.txt” located in the same directory as the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database.</p>
<p>Brood year calculations subject the forecast abundance of an age to the current fishing year’s fishery inputs, calculate the resulting escapement as well as the number of fish remaining in the ocean and advance to the next age. The resulting age+1 is then also subjected to the same fishery inputs, until age 5 is reached. Thus the same fishery inputs are used for all four ages (2-5) resulting from a brood year. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> algorithms are applied to each age class in forward and reverse mode.</p>
<p>Note that, in contrast, a “true” brood year run would apply fishery inputs from the first year to age 2s, compute the resulting age 3s, apply fishery inputs from year+1 to these age 3s, compute the resulting age 4s, apply fishery inputs from year+2 to these age 4s, compute the resulting age 5s, and finally apply fishery inputs from year+3 to the age 5s.</p>

<div id="no-size-limit-fix" class="section level3">
<h3>No size limit fix</h3>
<p><span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> allows for evaluations of the effect of changes in minimum size limit regulations to fishery catches and stock impacts. Size limits are altered infrequently in hook and line salmon fisheries. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>’s original size limit evaluation algorithms were problematic, because they resulted in changes to the number of total encounters with each size limit change. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> uses different rates to model encounters of legal and sublegal fish. These rates are computed during the calibration process and are based on landed catch and encounter information during base period years (currently brood years 2005-2008).</p>
<p>When size limits are modeled in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, each fish smaller than the size limit is treated as a sublegal fish. Sublegal encounter rates are used to compute releases and release mortalities. Conversely, each fish larger than the size limit is deemed legal and legal encounter rates are used to estimate catch as well as releases and release mortalities in mark selective fisheries. As the size limit is changed, a portion of the population (with sizes between the old and the new size limit) that previously received a sublegal encounter rate will receive a legal encounter rate or vice versa. Because legal and sublegal encounter rates are not the same for the same stock and age, this leads to the total number of computed encounters varying with size limits, an incorrect outcome, if effort remains constant.</p>
<p><span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> incorporates corrected equations that hold total encounters constant, regardless of the modeled size limit (<span class="citation">@ahb2013</span>, <span class="citation">@mchugh2015</span>, <span class="citation">@johnson2015</span>).</p>
<p>In a first round of evaluations, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> computes sublegal encounters using sublegal/legal ratios based on recent field data (i.e., length-frequency data for Chinook encounters in recreational test fisheries). These ratios are updated each year in the [Project database tables] “SLRatio”. To produce the desired sublegal encounters, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> iteratively calculates an “Encounter Rate Adjustment” for each fishery and time step, such that sublegal encounters summed over stocks and ages within a fishery and time step produce the target sublegal/legal ratios, given legal sized, landed catch inputs (fishery scalers or quotas). Once run, “Encounter Rate Adjustments” are stored in the “RunEncounterRateAdjustment” column of the “SLRatio” table.</p>
<p>Size limit changes are evaluated with Van Bertalanffy growth equations. These equations determine the proportion legal and or/sublegal by stock and age under desired size limit regulations. The model calculates the legal and sublegal encounters for both the original and new minimum size limit and then adjust the differences so that total encounters remain constant.</p>
<p>When the new size limit is less than the base-period size limit, the difference in sublegal encounters between the base size-limit and the new size-limit becomes landed catch that is added to the calculated landed catch evaluated at the base-period size limit. Encounters are calculated by dividing the encounter estimates by the sublegal release mortality rate.</p>
<p>Conversely, when the new size limit is greater than the base-period size limit, the difference in landed catch between the new size limit and the base-period size limit becomes sublegal encounters. This encounter difference is added to the calculated sublegal encounters from the base-period size limit to get total sublegal encounter mortality.</p>
<p><strong>When this button is checked</strong>, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> will not automatically update the encounter rate adjustments needed to achieve desired sublegal/legal ratios and instead use the encounter rate adjustments in the existing model run. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> will also revert to original size limit evaluation algorithms, where total encounters can fluctuate when size limits are changed.</p>
<p>If unsure, please leave this button unchecked (default), as the default setting will produce the most accurate run. However, there are several reasons to check the “No-Size-Limit-Fix” button:</p>
<ul>
<li>To speed up the run, as sublegal encounter iterations, especially when performed with <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, can be very time consuming. However, for correct results, the following assumptions need to be met:
<ul>
<li>“Encounter Rate Adjustments” were updated during a previous model run and will result in desired sublegal/legal ratios (see Background paragraph above).</li>
<li>The sublegal/legal ratios in the database were computed for the same size limits that exist in the current model run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For backwards compatibility to reproduce an “old-style” (pre 2013) run</li>

<h3>Cohort T4 pre 2012 Processing</h3>
<p>This button exists for backwards compatibility reasons. Prior to 2012, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> would not have reused time step 1 forecasts in time step 4 for ages with a missing “age minus 1” abundance. Chinook age up in time step 4; i.e. an age 2 fish becomes an age 3 fish, an age 3 fish turns age 4, etc. Previously, if a stock was not expected to return at a certain age, time 4 of age+1 would have been left blank. Since 2012, for these stocks, time step 4 of a given age reuses the time step 1 abundance of the same age.</p>

<h3>S:L ratio update</h3>
<p>Since 2014, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> computes sublegal encounters using sublegal/legal ratios (<span class="citation">@mchugh2015</span>, <span class="citation">@johnson2015</span>). These ratios are usually derived from recent field data (i.e., length-frequency data for Chinook encounters in recreational test fisheries) and updated annually in the “SLRatio” table of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>’s ACCESS database. To produce the desired sublegal encounters, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> iteratively calculates an “Encounter Rate Adjustment” for each fishery and time step such that sublegal encounters summed over stocks and ages within a fishery and time step produce the target sublegal/legal ratios, given legal sized landed catch inputs (fishery scalers or quotas). Once run, “Encounter Rate Adjustments” are stored in the “RunEncounterRateAdjustment” column of the “SLRatio” table.</p>
<p>The “S:L Ratio Update” button is a relic from pre-2019 FRAM.exe releases. The new <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> default (leave “No Size Limit Fix” button unchecked) automatically updates Encounter Rate Adjustments with each model run in the course of computing size limit corrected legal and sublegal encounters.</p>
<p>When this button is clicked, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> will calculate “Encounter Rate Adjustments” for each fishery and time step such that sublegal encounters summed over stocks and ages within a fishery and time step produce the target sublegal/legal ratios. These ratios are then stores in the “RunEncounterRateAdjustment” column of the “SLRatio” table.</p>
<p>A message box will appear when clicking the “S:L Ratio Update” button.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_adv_slratio.png" width="70%" /></p>
<p>The user then has the option to check “Load TargetRatio from spreadsheet” box before clicking the “Initialize” button. This brings up a file selection dialog box. Choose the file with the desired sublegal/legal ratios. The file will most likely have “SL Ratios…” in the title and contain a tab called “SLRatioImport”. If the ratios are already loaded, leave this box unchecked. As soon as the ratios are loaded in the database, within a few seconds of clicking “Initialize”, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>’s “Run-Menu” will appear. Select the “Run Model” button to run <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> as usual.</p>
<p>Since “Encounter Rate Adjustments” are automatically updated in the default mode, selecting this option only makes sense in combination with clicking the “No Size Limit Fix” button. This results in a model run with updated “Encounter Rate Adjustments”, but old size limit evaluations. Doing so is only advisable if the user is sure that size limits in the current model run are compatible with the sublegal/legal ratios in the database. One other reason to select the “S:L Ratio Update” button is the option to programmatically load target sublegal/legal ratios from an Excel workbook as described above.</p>

This report demonstrates the stock contribution (in numbers of non-<span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> fish) to a hypothetical total mortality of 1,000 fish in each fishery/time step. Only a single stock component can be selected (i.e. only the Skookum Creek Hatchery Marked stock can be viewed and a separate selection would be necessary to see the results for the Skookum Creek Hatchery Unmarked stock).</p>

<h2>Report Drivers</h2>
<p>Report drivers generate 14 pre-formatted output report types using unique instructions found in the report driver. Many of these reports are also available as screen reports or found in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> output to <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> files. A report driver is species-specific, tied to a unique base period for parameters, and contains a header with metadata. The output reports are given a .PRN file extension and can be opened with a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad. The actual report drivers, with instructions on what to include, are stored in the <span title="MS: Microsoft">MS</span> Access project database table ReportDriver.</p>
<p>From the main menu, select “Output/Results”, “Report Driver File”, to get to the report driver file options. The most straightforward step is to “Select Driver” from the available report drivers already in the project database table ReportDriver. Click the checkbox next to one from the list and you will be re-directed back to the driver file options menu. Next, click the “Run Reports” button to name and save the output <span title="PRN: .PRN file">PRN</span> file. Once you click save from the prompt, the output <span title="PRN: .PRN file">PRN</span> file is generated and ready to view. The “Edit Report Driver” option is no longer functional in updated versions of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> and thus a new report driver must be created to make changes from an old one. Changes to a report driver need to be made in the project database table ReportDriver.</p>
<p>Many <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> databases include various previously created custom report drivers. To create a new report driver, select “Output/Results”, “Report Driver File”, “Create Report Driver”. Select the desired report from the 14 available options and specify parameters for customization from the selection boxes. A good example of a unique, customizable report is the “Terminal Run Summary”. This report allows the user to specify fisheries and time steps for inclusion in the terminal run definition of selected stocks. When prompted, save the driver. The new driver will then appear in the “Select Driver” report selection box. To produce output, select the new driver and click “Run Report”.</p>

<h1><span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span></h1>
<p>The current Terminal Area Management Module is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that interfaces with the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> application, providing additional input parameter values and receiving outputs following a run.</p>
<p>The <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMMs</span> for Chinook and coho differ in most details, but both share a general conceptual division into sheets related to <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> inputs, those compiling <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> outputs, and then those that draw from these first two classes to perform numerous additional calculations and manipulations associated with particular tabular report breakouts. Regional areas in Puget Sound are also represented within individual sheets to customize output for regional management perspectives. In addition, a Documentation sheet notes modifications and/or revisions made to the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file or structure overall (e.g. a formula error was fixed or a new section was added), and a RunLog sheet notates model input changes between model runs during an annual preseason planning process.</p>
<p>For preseason runs, the typical naming convention follows a pattern of “specNNYY”, with “Chin” or “Coho” followed by an “comanager agreed” run number and the 2-digit year. For example, the final 2019 Chinnok model run was “Chin2719” while the coho file was “Coho1925”.</p>
<p>Note that the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> files contain historical information, including outdated tables or sheets. Over the years, perspectives and technical approaches have changed and yet the older pages or sections remain. Preserving these historical approaches in case they are needed again, while adding new or updating content can create confusion about which content is maintained and relevant. Some completely obsolete sheets are hidden using Excel and an attempt is made to hide columns or sections of sheets that are no longer used.</p>

<h2>Running <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> with <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span></h2>
<p><strong>Note: An “official” <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run should always be run with a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>!</strong></p>
<p><span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> is rooted in the management history of Puget Sound Chinook and Coho salmon. Prior to the existence of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, spreadsheet models calculated terminal fisheries’ impacts with ‘simple harvest rates’. A harvest rate is computed as terminal catch divided by terminal abundance. Abundance accounting occurred in run reconstruction spreadsheets that calculated terminal abundance as escapement + freshwater landed catch + terminal landed catch. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> introduced the ability to calculate stock specific impacts in mixed stock pre-terminal areas using exploitation rates. Exploitation rates are computed as catch of a stock divided by the abundance of the stock. Whereas harvest rates are area-specific, exploitation rates are stock-specific. Using harvest rates in terminal areas with typically very low proportions of non-local stocks introduced an acceptable amounts of error, while providing the convenience of simple calculations.</p>
<p>The practice of computing harvest rates in terminal and extreme terminal fisheries continues to this day. Unfortunately, it is incompatible with <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> exploitation rate calculations. <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> reports terminal harvest rates to <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> translates these harvest rates into exploitation rates through an iterative process. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> uses instructions about the stock/fishery make-up of the terminal area in order to reconstruct the denominator of the original harvest rate calculation. Given these denominators, the model calculates landed catches and associated fishery scalers. <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> also computes non-local stock impacts in terminal areas. Landed catches and fishery scalers are saved to the model run database.</p>
<p>Upon selecting to “Run Model” a submenu presents the user with the option to “Select <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>”. If this option is chosen, a file selection dialogue box appears. Select the desired <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> and click “Open”. After <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> completes iterations, the following message box pops up, and selecting “Yes” results in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> importing output into the <a href="#tamx">TAMX</a> for Chinook or <a href="#prn-sheets">PRN Sheets</a> for Coho. Note that although values are imported, they are not yet saved and require standard Excel saving procedures.</p>

<p>There are two primary reasons to run a <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model <strong>with</strong> a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file. Although these reasons often apply, it is acceptable to run <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> without <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> if they do not. This can speed up the time it takes to perform a Chinook model run. However <em>there can be interactions between input into <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> (from TAMI) and outputs from <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> into <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> so that it may take more than one iteration of cycling <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> output back into <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, before TAMI values stabilize. This is especially noteworthy for runs with significant abundance and /or fishery changes.</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> input is needed</li>

<ul>
<li><p><span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> has not been run with a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file before or sheet TAMI and/or <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> inputs have changed since the model was last run with a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file. Once <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> runs with a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file, static input values for <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> fisheries are stored in the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> project database. For Chinook, when the model is run a second time, a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> may not be needed to reproduce the model run results from the first run with a <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there are some TAMI fishery inputs in the coho <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, which are dependent on model results of terminal run size to subsequently update the input value when other fishery inputs are modified. This type of iteration is not built into the software for Puget Sound fisheries and thus the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file is dynamic in terms of updating terminal fishery inputs. The coho <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> is also used for <span title="WA: Washington">WA</span> coastal terminal fisheries, which utilize a selected button to run built-in software iterations which update input values that are dependent on model results of terminal run size.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Many sheets in the Coho <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> workbook involve post-processing calculations and formatted reporting. The sections below focus on a subset of sheets likely to be the focus of the majority of user interactions.</p>
<p>Coho <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> sends to <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>: - Tami sheet – contains <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> inputs; a precursor sheet with more details about Tami values is Input_Harvestnew - WACoastTerminal – contains <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> inputs when using “Run Coastal Iterations”</p>

<div id="input_harvestnew" class="section level3">
<h3>Input_Harvestnew</h3>
<p>For a subset of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fisheries and a subset of time steps, fishery proposals can be represented as fishery inputs and entered into the Input_Harvestnew sheet. Only September (time step 4) and October-December (time step 5) time steps can be modeled as <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> fishery inputs. These fishery inputs can be in terms of: catch, fishery effort scalars, Terminal Area Abundance (<span title="TAA: Terminal Area Abundance">TAA</span>) harvest rates, or Extreme Terminal Run Size (ETRS) harvest rates. Harvest rate fishery inputs are only possible as <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> inputs and have a separate methodology for iterations between <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> and <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>. Values are then compiled from Input_Harvestnew into the TAMI sheet and passed from <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> to <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="tami" class="section level3">
<h3>Tami</h3>
<p>The Tami sheet compiles values from the Input_Harvestnew sheet and passes them to <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. A separate flagging system is used in the Coho Tami sheet to depict each type of fishery input: flag 1 = catch, flag 2 = effort scalar, 3 = <span title="TAA: Terminal Area Abundance">TAA</span> harvest rate, 4 = ETRS harvest rate. A flag value of -99 tells <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> to ignore <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> inputs and to use the inputs provided within the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> interface/database.</p>
<p>The Tami sheet also contains information needed for harvest rate iteration calculations. Fishery harvest rate inputs are provided with a specific definition of how that rate was calculated, so that <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> can apply it correctly. A numeric system is used to represent these definitions and are stored in the Coho <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> project database table “TAAETRSList”. The numeric value for which harvest rate definition is associated with the fishery input is provided on the Tami sheet under Abundance Definitions. In general, the <span title="TAA: Terminal Area Abundance">TAA</span> rates are calculated with total catch while the <span title="ETRS: Extreme terminal run size">ETRS</span> rates only include catch of local stocks.</p>
</div>
<div id="wacoastterminal" class="section level3">
<h3>WACoastTerminal</h3>
<p>The WACoastTerminal sheet is used ensure that <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>’s catch composition of local stocks in Washington coastal terminal fisheries (per base period and time step) are consistent with the stock catch composition derived with regional harvest management planning models. Stock-specific harvest rates from regional harvest management models are input into the WACoastTerminal sheet. These rates are applied against the stock’s terminal run size from <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> output. The <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> ratio of local to non-local stocks is used to then calculate a total catch for each terminal fishery, which is apportioned to time step based on regional models. These catch inputs are then summarized into a formatted table in the lower section of the sheet and read back into <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> using the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model run specification button “Run Coastal Iterations”.</p>
<p>Within this sheet, a fishery flag value of -99 tells <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> to ignore <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> inputs using the local stock-specific harvest rates and base subsequent calculations for evaluating management on the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> catch composition only (per base period and time step). For preseason planning, a fishery flag of -88 is used in the sheet so that subsequent calculations for evaluating management utilize the resulting stock catch composition consistent with the regional harvest management planning models.</p>
</div>
<div id="prn-sheets" class="section level3">
<h3>PRN Sheets</h3>
<p>There are four “PRN” sheets in the Coho <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file, which are created by driver files (.DRV) as defined in the coho <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> project database table “ReportDriver”. These provide direct output of model results from each <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model run. Hyperlinks to individual sections within the sheet are found in the upper right section, and the key strokes Control+Home can be used to return to the top of the sheet. The four “PRN” sheets are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>FishSumAllPRN – Generated by FisherySummaryAllMortalities.DRV definitions. Summarizes impacts for all Coho stocks in each fishery and time step. These include sections for a.) landed catch, b.) shaker mortality (drop-off and drop-out mortalities), c.) non-retention mortality (CNR inputs and mark-selective release mortalities), d.) landed catch plus non-retention mortality, e.) total mortality.</li>
<li>StockSumAllPRN – Generated by CohoStockSummary.DRV definitions. Reports total mortality by stock (marked and unmarked) summed over all fisheries and time steps.</li>
<li>Table2PRN – Generated by PSCTable2.DRV definitions. Reports total mortality for a specified stock or stock aggregate by time step. There is also a configured section for verifying stock-specific fishery rate scalars for the non-treaty and treaty Area 8D net fisheries impacts on marked stocks.</li>
<li>TRunsPRN – Generated by PSCTRuns.DRV definitions. For aggregates of various fisheries or stocks, reports values for a.) terminal run size, b.) escapement, and c.) terminal run size with all mortality for stock aggregates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sheet-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Sheet “2”</h3>
<p>This sheet contains multiple tables for Coho fishery impact summary highlights. Total fishery related mortality is presented for aggregated fisheries and stocks. Various statistics are calculated and compared to management guidelines. These are dependent upon stock and regional management approaches. Table format differs for Puget Sound, Washington coast, and hatchery stocks summaries.</p>
</div>
<div id="sheet-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Sheet “4”</h3>
<p>This sheet contains a summary table of Coho exploitation rates by fishery aggregate for key Puget Sound and Washington natural stocks. Rates are calculated for ocean exploitation, Puget Sound exploitation, total exploitation, and southern US exploitation. In addition, treaty and non-treaty rates are presented as sub-categories.</p>

<h3>TAMI</h3>
<p>The TAMI sheet passes in values for several fisheries. A flag value of -88 tells <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> to ignore <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> inputs and to use the inputs provided within the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database.</p>

<p>Additional flags determine whether the parameter values are interpreted as a rate or count (i.e., number of fish), with the values themselves derived from <a href="#input-page">Input Page</a> entries and additional calculations on area-specific sheets.</p>
<p>For example, in the screenshot shown above, the Bellingham Bay values that are sent to FRAMM first pass through the “NS” Nooksack-Samish sheet from the block of input page cells denoted <em>“Rate” is %TAA Nooksack-Samish Aggregate Summer/Fall chinook.</em></p>

<p>As general good practice, after making any changes to <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> fishery parameters, particularly those that are passed to and processed within <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, it may be worthwhile to ensure that the intended behavior occurred by checking relevant screen reports and/or <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> output sheets.</p>

<h3>Input Page</h3>
<p>This sheet is divided (row-wise) into sections for stock forecasts, net fisheries, and sport fisheries, with each of these primary sections further subdivided by river basins. Note that in addition to the text descriptions, hover/tooltip Excel comments are associated with several cells and can provide greater context.</p>
<p>During the pre-season process, values are agreed-to stock forecasts and anticipated fisheries from regional co-managers.</p>
<p>When performing post-season runs, the values are agreed-to abundance estimates from regional co-managers and observed fishery catches from co-manager technical staff.</p>

<p>The exploitation rate and escapement overview approximates a primary “dashboard” of <span title="ESA: Endangered Species Act">ESA</span> compliance for the Washington comanagers, displaying estimated exploitation rates and escapements relative to the critical thresholds defined in stock-specific management unit plans (which are also listed in the RMP_Mgmt_Criteria sheet).</p>
<p>Conditional formatting indicates stocks with exploitation rates exceeding management targets. In pre-season runs, this indicates that fishery adjustments will be necessary to meet management objectives.

<h1>Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span></h1>
<p>“Forward” <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model runs begin from a forecasted “pre-fishing” cohort and then apportion fishery impacts to the model stocks through the species-specific time steps. This conceptually parallels the observed seasonal progression of salmon returning to spawning grounds and release areas.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast, a “backward” <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> (<span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span>) model run combines observed terminal run size and escapement values with observed catch values to iteratively derive a set of recruit scalers, such that those scalers produce a starting cohort capable of producing the known catch and escapement. Starting cohorts are initial <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run sizes before natural mortality, fishing mortality, and maturation. For Chinook, <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> calculates age 3 to 5 starting cohorts, and for Coho, starting cohorts are in units of January Age 3 fish. This process is conceptually related to traditional “run reconstruction” approaches.</p>
<p>These runs play several important roles.</p>
<p>During the preseason planning process, Chinook forecasts are commonly reported in terms of terminal run size. Thus, the initial preseason Chinook model run is actually a backwards model run that enables the reconstruction of a starting cohort for all subsequent preseason modeling. This “average run” is a backwards Chinook <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run that targets the new season’s terminal return forecasts (by stock) in the context of fishery parameters averaged from recent observed years.</p>
<p>Following completion of a fishing year, a post-season backwards run is performed to incorporate the most current representation of what actually happened. Note that in addition to the new year, updates to the data characterizing older years may also be integrated during this process. The Pacific Salmon Commission’s Coho Technical Committee (<span title="CoTC: Coho Technical Committee">CoTC</span>) conducts post-season Coho model runs to evaluate annual Pacific Salmon Treaty obligations. The salmon co-managers (Washington Treaty Tribes and <span title="WDFW: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife">WDFW</span>) conduct post-season Chinook model runs, which can be found on their website at: <a href="https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/fram-model-runs/post-season-fram-modeling/" class="uri">https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/fram-model-runs/post-season-fram-modeling/</a></p>
<p><span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> can be run for an individual stock or a combination of stocks (including all stocks). It requires a “seed” run that contains desired fishery impacts (observed values for post-season runs or recent year average values for pre-season runs). The seed run will also contain starting cohorts for stocks where this parameter is known; i.e. the forecast is already in starting cohort units rather than terminal run size units.</p>
<p><span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> can run in three modes. The mode is selected using a flag in the input process. Flags are stock-specific, allowing all three flags (values = 0,1,2) to be used in a single <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> model run.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mode 0 (flag 0): This mode does not use <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> to find starting stock scalars. Instead, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> uses the starting cohort values from the existing “StockRecruit” table in the project database.</p></li>
<li><p>Mode 1 (flag 1): This mode uses an algorithm to iteratively adjust stock recruit scalars until the target abundance is achieved. Target abundances are adipose mark specific. This method is used when the mark rate of a stock is known.</p></li>
<li><p>Mode 2 (flag 2): This mode is selected when target mark rates are unavailable. Algorithms from mode 1 are used to find the starting stock recruit scalars that result in the combined target abundance (marked and unmarked components). The program will then apply mark rates derived from the existing “StockRecruit” table to split starting cohorts into marked and unmarked components.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="running-bkfram" class="section level2">
<h2>Running <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span></h2>
<p>After selecting “Post Season run” from the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> main menu, the Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> submenu is presented. The Coho and Chinook versions are slightly different.</p>

<p>Next, target abundance values must be set if they are not already. Selecting the ’Target Escapements” button brings up the Target Escapements for Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> menu, which has a slightly different layout for Chinook and Coho.</p>
</div>
<div id="target-escapements-for-chinook" class="section level2">
<h2>Target escapements for Chinook</h2>
<p>The values for the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> calculations to target must be provided by stock, mark status, and age, in conjunction with a control flag. The effects of flag values are displayed on screen, with <code>0</code> meaning the value is not used, <code>1</code> it is used, and <code>2</code> that it is intended to be automatically split into marked and unmarked components. A flag value of <code>3</code> is deprecated but allowed for legacy compatibility.</p>
<p>When terminal run size is known for a stock by age and mark status, these can be entered with a flag of “1” in the correspondingly labeled cells. If the mark rate is unknown, enter the combined (marked plus unmarked) abundance in the “TOTAL” row and flag as “2” (i.e. will use mark rates from “seed run”). If you do not wish to overwrite existing cohort sizes for a stock, flag relevant row(s) (Total, Marked, Unmarked) as “0”.</p>
<p>While the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> interface enables editing individual values, the “Import Escapements” option allows an “all-at-once” update via the selection of an <span title="MS: Microsoft">MS</span> Excel template file containing model inputs compiled outside of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. Select the “Import Escapements” button and then locate and selecting the file (“BkFRAM_ChinookTemplate…xls”) with the desired values.</p>

<p>Once the input values are updated, select “OK - Done” to return to the Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Run Menu to “Start Iterations”.</p>
<p>The following table represents which Chinook <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fisheries (by FisheryID numeric values and generic titles) and time steps (horizontal) are included in the run size definition of each stock (by StockID numeric values and StockName) (vertical). A “yes” denotes that the landed catch of ages 3-5 Chinook in fishery and time steps are added to the age 3-5 run to the river (escapement + freshwater catch). <span title="T1: Time step 1">T1</span> equals October-April time step, <span title="T2: Time step 2">T2</span> equals May-June time step, and <span title="T3: Time step 3">T3</span> equals July-September time step</p>
</div>
<div id="target-escapements-for-coho" class="section level2">
<h2>Target escapements for Coho</h2>
<p>Enter target escapements by stock and mark status and flag as “1” in the correspondingly labeled cells. Coho escapement values should exclude jacks (age 2), as coho are assumed to be age 3 in the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model framework. If the mark rate is unknown, enter the combined (marked plus unmarked) escapement in either the marked or unmarked stock row and flag as “2” (will use mark rates from “seed run”). If you do not wish to overwrite exisiting cohort sizes for a stock, flag relevant row(s) (Marked, Unmarked) as “0”.</p>
<p>Escapement values can also be loaded from a <span title="MS: Microsoft">MS</span> Excel template file designed for model inputs (“CohoFRAMInputTemplate….xls”) by selecting the “Import Escapements” button and then locating and selecting the file with the desired values. The template file workbook needs to contain a worksheet tab called “FRAMEscapeV2”, and the user may need to unhide it within the template. The escapement values within the worksheet are organized as rows by stock and mark status and columns per year. A column exists for every year desired for updating model inputs. The program will request a single ‘Year’ to load from the Excel worksheet.</p>
<p>Escapement values can be also be exported by selecting the “Export to Spreadsheet” button on the Target Escapements for Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> menu using the same workbook template file needed for importing. The program will also request the ‘Year’ of data to export.</p>
<p>Once the input values are updated, select “OK - Done” to return to the Backwards <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Run Menu to “Start Iterations”.</p>
</div>
<div id="start-iterations" class="section level2">
<h2>Start iterations</h2>
<p>With target escapements entered, the number of desired iterations can be selected and then “Start Iterations” clicked. The default number of iterations is 99. This number will rarely be reached, as iterations automatically terminate when the convergence criteria is met (run size within 1 fish of target).</p>
<p>For Coho, selecting the “Run without <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> Bias Correction (if checked)” button will process the backwards run without the MSF Bias Correction factor applied. By default, the <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> Bias Correction is applied during preseason forward Coho <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> modeling and thus it is also by default applied during backward <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. Thus, this box is most commonly left unchecked.</p>
<p>For Chinook, selecting the “Age 2 from 3” box will cause the program to process using fishing year (<span title="FY: Fishing Year">FY</span>) age 2 from 3 abundances (e.g., the recruit scaler for age 3s will be used for age 2s). This corresponds to the preseason mode of operation. After selecting “Start Iterations”, a prompt requires the user to select whether or not to use TAMI catches for the run. Choosing “yes” is appropriate if the correct TAMI fishery catches (e.g., 7BCD net) are not yet loaded into <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. Conversely, “no” will skip this step when the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run already has the correct TAMI catches stored (i.e, because <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> has already been run forward with the correct <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> and TAMI catches are automatically saved into the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database).</p>
</div>
<div id="view-and-save-bkfram-results" class="section level2">
<h2>View and save <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> results</h2>
<p>After iterations are complete, the program returns a result screen (with slightly different layouts for Chinook and Coho) which lists target escapements, resulting <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> escapements, and new stock recruit scalers side by side in order to assess whether values have sufficiently converged.</p>

<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>Finally, after exiting the table display, a new option to “Save <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> targets and new Recruit Scalars[sic]” is available.</p>
<p>If no further changes to escapement or flagging are needed, this will write values to the database before returning to the main menu.</p>
<p>The “Save <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span>…” button brings up the following message box: “This action saves BkFRAMTargets as well as Recruit Scalars. To save, please follow instructions of next menu.” Then the ‘Save-Menu’ pops-up, where the user can select to replace the existing run, save as a new run, or cancel save. Note that if the user selects the “Save <span title="BkFRAM: Backward FRAM">BkFRAM</span> Targets and New Recruit Scalars” button after the targets are entered or imported, but before iterations are run, the save action will only save the new targets.</p>

<h2>Edit model run info</h2>
<p>Selecting this option provides an interface to alter some of the metadata associated with an existing run, particularly the name, title, year and comments (stored in <code>RunID</code> table in the database [Lookups]). Best practices encourage entering careful, comprehensive notes for future reference.</p>
<p>When changes are cumulative across numerous runs, such as in a preseason or “forward” context, comments may often refer to prior runs for ease of reading (i.e., “started with run N, changed X, Y, and Z”). Preseason model runs often start with the beginning model run notes and add sequentially above those as the preseason progresses, so that the newest changes describing the run are at the top for easy viewing. The Comments field cannot be deleted and left blank or <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> will throw an error message. If this happens, click “Quit” and re-try.</p>

<p>As shown in the [Make a run copy] section of [A basic forward run], this option conveniently provides the starting point for further work to examine scenarios for the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> management units. Recall that a given “run” is spread across numerous tables in a project database and involves many rows within some tables. Consequently, this utility helps save time and avoid error by ensuring that all necessary steps to create a new model run are completed. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It is common practice to copy an existing run, re-name it something new, make input changes, and generate updated model results from the new run.</p>
<p>Having reached the “NEW Copied Recordset Information” screen, specify an informative <code>RunName</code> and <code>RunTitle</code> in the respective fields. In addition, the free-text “Comments” field is an important place to document the planned changes, the original run it is based on, the date a change was made and by whom, etc. This is also easily updated later with any further changes (see <a href="#edit-model-run-info">Edit model run info</a>). After entering a good description of what will change, click “Ok - done” to complete the process and return to the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> utilities menu, with the newly copied run loaded into memory. <em>Note that this step involves writing to disk and may take a few seconds - no need to panic if <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> hangs momentarily.</em></p>

<p>This option provides a convenient means to comprehensively remove one or several runs from a database. Selecting the “Delete Model Run” button prompts a screen listing available runs. After selecting a single model run name in the list, a confirmation prompt again displays what will be removed. If you are certain you wish to delete the model run, click “Yes” - or - click “No” to return to the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Utilities menu. The currently active model run cannot be deleted with this utility, and attempting to do so will produce an error prompt.

<p>Clicking the “Transfer Model Runs” button in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Utilities will prompt a message box “Please select the Transfer Database” and the user clicks “OK”. At that point, a file selection dialogue appears for a “template” model run transfer .mdb file into which the transferred values will be written. Be sure to utilize a “blank” template model run transfer file, or any model runs will be added to those that are already stored in the file. The current version of this template is generally provided on the <a href="https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/fram-model-runs/pre-season-fram-model-files/annual-pre-season-model-files/">Fisheries Services</a> site.</p>
<p>After an appropriate template is chosen, a “Model Run TRANSFER Selections” window appears with the list of available model runs in the project database.

</div>
<div id="read-old-base-period" class="section level2">
<h2>Read old base period</h2>
<p>Prior to 2011, base period data were stored in a text file with a <code>.out</code> extension, commonly referred to as outfiles. These historic outfiles are associated with <code>*.cmd</code> “command files”. The outfile information is equivalent to data stored in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> [Project database tables] containing a ‘BaseID’ field; i.e base period exploitation rates, maturation rates, growth functions, etc.</p>
<p>The “Read Old Base Period” utility reads the outfile and places the information in the relevant model run Access database tables; i.e. base period exploitation rates are stored in the “BaseExploitationRate” table.</p>
<p>However, importing an old model run (command file) and associated outfile into a modern <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database can be problematic, as some of the existing tables need to be compatible with the old data. The existing “Stock” table in the database has to include the stock version of the old outfile; i.e. version 1 for the old 76 stock structure of Chinook. Ideally, the “ChinookBaseSizeLimit” table should contain size limits from the old base period. Since the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Access database currently only accommodates size limits from one base period, it is not advisable to load runs from more than one base period.</p>
<p>Generally, the chance of run errors increases significantly with older model runs (command file) and the associated base period (outfile). Nevertheless, being able to quickly produce output summaries through Access queries is a huge advantage over the old method of retrieving output through driver files. It is highly advisable to compare TAMX output from the original run with output produced using the current version of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> before taking advantage of this functionality.</p>
<p>To import an old base period into a <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database, select “Utilities”, “Read Old Base Period”, pick the desired outfile and then press “Yes” when prompted to confirm that the base period is for Chinook.</p>

<h2>Delete/Transfer/Get base period</h2>
<p>Much as the above delete, transfer and get model run functions manipulate multiple tables throughout the project database, these options provide a similar means to handle entire base periods. Not all project databases will have more than one set of base period parameters, but these functions are important when this is the case.</p>
<p><strong>Until additional features are implemented for Chinook, a single base period should be utilized in a project database. This is due to some tables in the project database containing values unique to an individual base period, but the table is not tied to a unique BaseID.

<h2>Compute 2s from 3s (Chin)</h2>
<p>The abundances of 2 year olds are often not forecasted. Selecting this button will result in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> calculating the starting cohort of age 2s as a function of the 3s; i.e. produce a recruit scaler of 2 year olds that roughly produces the age 3 starting cohort. This is desirable for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On average (over time), age 2 scalers should be of a magnitude that is related to age three abundance, because age 2 fish will mature to become age 3 fish.</p></li>
<li><p>In <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, age 2 fish will become age 3 fish in time 4. Having age 2 abundances that are incompatible with age 3 abundances can result in large and undesirable exploitation rate swings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting this utility, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> applies a constant to the 3 year old starting cohort to calculate the 2 year old cohort. This links the age 2 and 3 recruit scalers similarly as a cohort reconstruction would. Most constants are close to 1.0 resulting in new age 2 scalers that are almost identical to the age 3 scalers.</p>
<p>To compute age 2 starting scalers, after clicking the “Compute 2s From3s (Chin)” button, the following window will pop up.</p>

<div id="read-old-cmd-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Read old CMD file</h2>
<p>Prior to 2011, annual <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> inputs were stored in a text file with a <code>.cmd</code> extension, commonly referred to as command files. This information is equivalent to data stored in all <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Access database tables containing a ‘RunID’ field; i.e annual model run information. These text files were opened, modified, and run in <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> version “FRAM555” or earlier. These versions of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> were coded in Visual Basic and preceded the currently in use <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Visual Studio.net versions with ADO.net database programming. The “Read Old CMD File” utility reads the command file and places the information in the relevant model run Access database tables; i.e. forecast information is stored in the “Cohort” table, retention fisheries inputs are placed in the “FisheryScalers” table. These historic command files are usually linked to old base periods which were stored in text files as well, with a *.out extension, commonly referred to as outfiles.

<p>The “Read <span title="TAA: Terminal area abundance">TAA</span>/<span title="ETRS: Extreme terminal run size">ETRS</span> File” button in the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Utilities is a seldom-used option to import old format CMD files (TAAETRSnum.txt) of the TAAETRSList table into the current project database structure.</p>
<p>The TAAETRSList table contains definitions (by unique TaaNum) for terminal run parameters, including stocks, fisheries, and time steps (only 4=Sept, 5=Oct-Dec). These terminal definitions are used in the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> (sheet Tami) and <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> program code for certain algorithms. The TAAETRSList table is not tied to a specific model run (by unique RunID), and thus changes to this table over time will influence model run results from prior years if model runs are in the same project database, but had different terminal run parameter definitions each individual year. In addition, the TAAETRSList table is not included in a model run transfer file and thus definitions are not updated for each model run loaded into a project database.</p>
<p>Thus, the modeling strategy is to create new definitions within this table whenever a modification is necessary, rather than modifying current definitions. Thus, an older definition which matches an older <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> will remain in the table for model run use (i.e #5). A newer definition will match a newer <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> (i.e. #40). Both the older and newer values will remain in the same database table and thus multiple years of model runs can be utilized.</p>
<p>Starting in the preseason 2018 Coho project database, the TAAETRSList table has been updated to incorporate TaaNum definitions back through 2013, when the <span title="MS: Microsoft">MS</span> Access database structure was first implemented. Any TaaNum definition updates were also made in the starting <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> files provided at that time.</p>

<div id="linking-a-model-run-to-a-base-period" class="section level2">
<h2>Linking a model run to a base period</h2>
<p>In most cases, model runs will already be linked to the correct base period. Please be aware that altering this relationships may produce confusing results, and consider consulting with a lead <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> modeler if this seems necessary for your situation.</p>
<p>As noted in [Project database], a <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run is comprised of two major types of information: annually varying input data, and historic and mostly static base period parameter values (e.g., exploitation rates, growth rates, maturation rates, natural mortality rates, etc. derived during the calibration process)</p>
<p>The [Base period parameters] are in several tables which usually have a ‘BasePeriodID’ field in the first or second column. A <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database can contain multiple base periods, although, until further notice, it is not advisable to have base periods from different calibrations in the same database.</p>
<p>The column <code>BasePeriodID</code> of the <code>RunID</code> table contains the unique base period index to which the run is linked, and simply changing this value will link the run to the desired base period. (This might be informative, for example, in an analysis adjusting growth or maturation rates while fixing stock recruitment and fishery intensity.)</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong> Base period IDs are unique to a <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database. They are automatically incremented when a user imports a new base period and consequently different databases can have different base period IDs for the same base period.</p>
<p>To link a base period to a model run during import (i.e., <a href="#get-model-run-transfers">Get model run transfers</a>), <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> will first look for the <code>BasePeriodID</code> specified in the <code>RunID</code> table of the transfer database. It will then determine the <code>BasePeriodName</code> associated with that <code>BasePeriodID</code> in the <code>BaseID</code> table, and search for this base period name in the recipient database. However, base period names are not always unique. The same “BaseID” table can have several different base periods with the same name.</p>
<p>There are three possible outcomes of this process, but the second and third are uncommon, because the user will rarely be confronted with a database that either contains multiple base periods with the same name or a need to associate a run with a base period that is not already present in the main database.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>In order to allocate impacts to each of these sub-areas during preseason model runs, the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> <em>Mortality</em> output table is exported into the sheet <code>Data</code> of the file <code>FRAMMortalitiesNewBPAEQ_TEMPLATE_Round_6.2.xlsx</code>. The lookup tables in other sheets allow calculation of the <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> mortalities from the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> <em>Mortality</em> output table: <code>aeq</code> (providing <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> factor values), <code>RelMort</code> (providing sublegal mortality rates) and <code>TermFlags</code> (indicating if a fishery is terminal). The sheets <code>fish</code> and <code>stk</code> provide the names of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fisheries and stocks based on the <code>FisheryID</code> and <code>StockID</code> fields.</p>
<p>Consequently, the marked and unmarked <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> mortalities of the “Hood Canal Fall Fingerlings” (<code>StockID</code> 31 and 32) in the fishery ‘A 12 Sport’ (<code>FisheryID</code> 64) in the time steps 3 (July-September) and 4 (October-April) are calculated. Then, all non-retention <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> mortalities (‘<span title="NR: Non-retention">NR</span> <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span>’) are summarized for the time steps 3 and 4 and for the marked and unmarked components of ‘Hood Canal Fall Fingerlings’ and assigned to North of Ayock. Similarly, all mark-selective AEQ mortalities (‘<span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> Landed’ + ‘<span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> DO’ + ‘<span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> <span title="MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSF</span> Shaker’) are summarized and assigned to South of Ayock. These <span title="AEQ: Adult equivalent">AEQ</span> mortality values are then copied into the cells O46 &amp; O47 (time step 3) and O50 &amp; O51 (time step 4) of the sheets HdCmrkd (marked ‘Hood Canal Fall Fingerlings’) and HdCUnmrkd (unmarked ‘Hood Canal Fall Fingerlings’).</p>

<h4>South Puget Sound processing</h4>
<p>Abundance inputs provided by regional biologists for pre- and post-season runs for South Puget Sound <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> stocks (Minter, Chambers, Nisqually, McAllister, Deschutes, and stocks in Areas 13D–K) assume that 100% of the Chinook caught in marine area 13A belong to the Minter stock and 100% of the Chinook caught in marine area 13+ belong to the Deschutes stock. In reality, stock compositions of the South Sound catch differ from this assumption and are determined according to the harvest rate indices provided by regional biologists (see cells BX!20:BY!28 of the SPSmrkd and SPSUnmrkd tabs of the Chinook <a href="#tamm"><span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span></a>). <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> reapportions catches in marine area 13+ and 13A according to these harvest rate indices and the abundances of each <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> stock relative to the aggregate (cells CB20:CC28 of the SPSmrkd and SPSUnmrkd tabs of the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>).</p>
<p>As stock-specific catch in 13A and 13+ changes, the abundance inputs for each South Puget Sound stock must be updated. However, updates to abundance inputs alter the proportion of each stock’s contribution to the South Puget Sound aggregate. As stock contribution proportions are updated, catch estimates by <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> stock are updated. This necessitates an iterative process to get the correct stock abundance inputs and catch estimates by <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> stock.</p>
<p>There are two ways that the user could perform South Puget Sound iterations. There is a manual method built into the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMMs</span> within the “<span title="SPS: South Puget Sound">SPS</span> Abundance Iterations” tab. Instructions on how to complete South Puget Sound Iterations using the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> are available in rows 11 to 16 of this tab. Alternatively, an R script is available to perform South Puget Sound iterations; contact a lead <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> modeler for the latest version and additional information on dependencies. The current version requires updating the directory of the <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>(s) in line 13 and the list of <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file name(s) in line 17. The user must also ensure that the “Original Values” section of the “<span title="SPS: South Puget Sound">SPS</span> Abundance Iterations” tab (cells B21:E29) is correct. The R code can then process multiple <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMMs</span> in a single execution.</p>

<h4><span title="SRFI: Snake River Fall Index">SRFI</span> - Snake River Fall Index</h4>
<p>Snake River Fall Chinook are managed such that marked ocean exploitation rates of age 3 and 4 fish do not exceed 70% of the average marked ocean exploitation rate of age 3 and 4 fish from 1988 to 1993. Ocean exploitation rate information from 1988 to 1993 is derived from <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> validation runs, using a report driver file. To access the necessary report driver file via the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> interface, the user should navigate from the Main Menu to Report Driver File Options page (Output/Results button -&gt; Report Driver button). Next, the user should select the “SnakeU&amp;MER” driver using the salmon colored “Select Driver” button. Once the driver is selected, the user can run the report via the green “RUN Reports” button. Reports must be run for 1988 to 1993 as well as the run year being evaluated for compliance with the <span title="SRFI: Snake River Fall Index">SRFI</span>.</p>
<p>Results from the <span title="SRFI: Snake River Fall Index">SRFI</span> reports can be loaded into a <span title="SRFI: Snake River Fall Index">SRFI</span> template Excel file (available on request from <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> lead modelers). <span title="SRFI: Snake River Fall Index">SRFI</span> compliance can then be evaluated on the “SRFIsummary” tab after the template has been fully loaded with updated information.</p>

<h3>Why does <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> keep crashing when I try to load an .mdb?</h3>
<p>Do you have a database with the full set of tables? You may be trying to load a model run “transfer” database which is missing several important structural tables that <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> needs.</p>

<h3>Why does <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> keep telling me to enter a model run year when I can see a year value for my run?</h3>
<p>In the <code>RunID</code> table, <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> expects the <code>RunYear</code> field to be a “Short Text” class.

<p>Yes, and modifications to the same project database will appear across open instances. But this is probably not a great idea for an analysis examining “directional” parameter changes (e.g., 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% changes within a given year), particularly as the same <span title="TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file cannot be used with multiple instances of <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>.

<li id="fn2"><p>See <a href="https://github.com/Angelikahagen/MainFRAM_VS-Repo/blob/9985faadb23cd27b227cbe079113928e7035fddb/FramCalcs.vb#L3569">FramCalcs:ScaleCohort</a><a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Recall that <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is not spatiotemporally explicit. Rather, all fishery impacts and maturation adjustments are handled simultaneously across the vector of stocks (and ages for Chinook) within a given timestep and preterminal/terminal substep. Thus, all fisheries occurring in the same time step operate on the same abundance, and any <em>spatial</em> precedence is a function of the annual fishery sequence through time. For example, spring catches in Alaska do not directly influence spring catches in <span title="BC: British Columbia">BC</span> and <span title="WA: Washington">WA</span>. However, these geographic precursors do affect summer catches in Puget Sound and elsewhere due to time step/timing.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Note that creating a completely <em>de novo</em> “new”, blank run is not actually possible from the <span title="FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> application, but would require using other tools to initialize a new project.mdb with the necessary lookup and parameter tables.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
