<li><strong>Output/Results</strong> opens a secondary menu allowing selection of various [Outputs] following model run completion</li>
<li><strong>Exit</strong> closes the program</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="edit-model-run" class="section level1">
<h1>Edit model run</h1>
<p>FRAM allows users to explore different management scenarios by adjusting “inputs” ([Per-run parameters]) that control fishery and stock properties.</p>
<p>For some analyses, it may make sense to adjust model parameters outside of the FRAM application. For example, a uniform increase or decrease in a group of fisheries over multiple time steps may be accomplished more easily by manipulating the project database directly.</p>
<p>However, the main menu “Edit model run” button accesses a convenient interface for changing individual values within the application. Clicking this produces a submenu divided into further “Stock” and “Fishery” buttons.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_edit.png" width="100%" /></p>
<div id="stock-recruits" class="section level2">
<h2>Stock recruits</h2>
<p>Stock recruit scalers (<code>StockRecruit</code> in [Per-run parameters]) are multiplied against a base period abundance (<code>BaseCohort</code> in [Base period parameters]) to generate a starting, pre-fishing cohort by stock (and age for Chinook).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>These parameters represent the magnitude of the current stock abundance relative to that during the base period years. Thus, a stock recruit scaler of 1 indicates an annual abundance for that stock equal to the base period, a value &gt;1 is an abundance larger than the base period, and &lt;1 is an abundance smaller than the base period.</p>
<p>Coho ‘Recruit Cohort’ values are in January age-3 units, whereas Chinook ‘Recruit Cohort’ contains four age-class specific initial ocean abundance values.</p>
<p>For preseason forward runs, stock recruit scaler values are a function of stock-specific forecasts provided by technical staff at the beginning of the planning cycle. They are generally established at the outset of preseason planning and then updated if necessary as additional data are available for the year (i.e. Canadian Chinook forecasts are not usually available until the end of March). For Chinook, stock recruit scalers are typically produced from terminal run size forecasts by running <a href="#backwards-fram">Backwards FRAM</a>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, recruit scalers would not usually be manually adjusted during a typical forward model run, but the interface enables this possibility if, for example, one wanted to explore the implications of a much larger or smaller salmon return than was predicted or with a different age distribution (e.g., “what happens if stock X returns at half of what was forecast and/or with far more younger fish?”).</p>
<p>Note that updating the stock recruit scaler will automatically update the associated recruit cohort and vice versa.</p>
<p>The “Read Recruits” button can be used to load forecast values compiled in the external FRAMVSTemplate file from sheet FRAM_Recruits. Conversely, the “Fill Spreadsheet” button can be used to download values from the model run to the FRAMVSTemplate file, where additional notation or comments can be stored.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_edit_stock_recruit.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="stockfishery-scalers" class="section level2">
<h2>Stock/Fishery Scalers</h2>
<p>Stock-fishery-specific exploitation rate (ER) scalers allow adjustments to the base period directed impacts of a particular fishery on a specific stock or group of stocks within each time step. These scalers function act on the base period fishery-stock-specific ERs.</p>
<p>These parameters can provide a temporary fix to an identified issue in the FRAM base period calibration. They are also used to represent negotiated closures within a fishery (e.g. a spatial closure). Any such adjustments must be supported by an accepted external analysis of fishery-stock interactions which demonstrates how and why the fishery would be expected to have different stock-specific contribution levels than it had during the base period years (e.g. CWT recoveries or genetic stock identification).</p>
<p>Stock-fishery-specific ER scalers display 0 until a fishery is selected from the upper left drop-down menu.</p>
<p>If a fishery/time-step is not modeled, a “****” is displayed with blue highlight.</p>
<p>By default, the values are equal to 1, which means the base period exploitation rate is used. Thus, a value &gt;1 is a larger ER than the base period and &lt;1 is smaller than the base period ER.</p>
<p>After choosing the focal fishery, the desired values are directly input into each cell and the “Ok - Done” button writes those changes to the project database for the active model run. These changes then persist across subsequently copied runs.</p>
<p>Few to none of these scalers may be “actively” modifying the many possible stock-fishery combinations in a FRAM run, and the red “Show Active Scalers” button presents a secondary screen filtered to and highlighting those particular instances. Although values cannot be directly modified on this screen, it can serve as a useful check of the current model run parameterization.</p>

</div>
<div id="fishery-quotascalers" class="section level2">
<h2>Fishery Quota/Scalers</h2>
<p>These [Per-run parameters] control the representation of fishery effort and may be the most frequently adjusted FRAM element during preseason planning.</p>
<p>As noted in the [Edit input parameter values] section of [A Basic Forward Run], legal, landed catch fishery impacts are controlled by “quotas” and/or “scalers” which are in turn controlled by per-timestep <code>fishery flags</code>. Values entered or adjusted under the quota/scalers input menus are stored in the [Project database tables] <code>FisheryScalers</code>. Fisheries without an input will be modeled with a default fishery effort scaler of 0.0 (flag = 1).</p>
<p>The flag values (displayed in the interface) determine whether the fishery is treated as non-selective and/or mark selective, and whether catch is processed as a fixed expectation (quotas) or as effort relative to the base period (scalers). Both modes operate on the fishery as a whole, combining with stock and age specific exploitation rates to determine resulting impacts from the fishery.</p>
<p>Note that many fishery/time-step cells are filled with asterisks (****) designating a lack of base period information to model that stratum. If a fishery now operates in one of those time steps the input (and impacts) need to be combined with an adjacent fishery or time step.</p>
<p>A single value in the input interface (either a scaler or quota) can be entered, and once the model is run, the resulting associated value will be populated in the interface (e.g. enter a quota value here and proceed through the menus to complete a model run, which will then return the resulting scaler value for that entered quota). Several values can be entered or updated before clicking “OK – Done”.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/fvs_edit_fish_quotascaler.png" alt="Fishery flag effects are shown below the current scaler and quota values." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Fishery flag effects are shown below the current scaler and quota values.
</p>
</div>
<p>The values for mark-selective fisheries are displayed on a secondary input screen that is displayed after selecting “Ok - done”. Only fishery and time steps flagged in the first fishery controls screen as mark-selective or a combination with a mark-selective component will be present in the secondary MSF input screen (flags 7, 8, 17, 18, 27,28; displaying a magenta highlight in Scaler/Quota cells). <strong>Thus, if you want to enter a MSF or change a MSF input parameter, be sure it is flagged as such first.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to scaler and quota inputs, the MSF fishery controls input screen also contains four additional input parameters. Some of these parameters are derived and agreed-to each preseason planning cycle by salmon co-managers and others are set by the PFMC management process. Thus, some stay fairly static year-to-year and some change annually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release Rate: Hooking release mortality rate (landed fish then released)</li>
<li>Marked MisID: Release rate of marked fish that could be legally retained</li>
<li>UnMark MisID: Retention rate of unmarked fish that should have been released</li>
<li>DropOff Rate: Fishery-related mortality rate (fish that escape but die due to injury)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note these four MSF input parameters cannot have a zero value and must be &gt;0.0000.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/fvs_edit_fish_quotascaler_msf.png" alt="Mark-selective values are displayed on a second interface after approving non-selective values." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Mark-selective values are displayed on a second interface after approving non-selective values.
</p>
</div>
<p>Altering a fishery <code>quota</code> has fairly intuitive implications (though the target value may itself result from considerable additional calculation external to FRAM). In contrast, the particular numeric effects of altering <code>fishery scalers</code> requires more prior knowledge of the base period practices (and stock composition).</p>
<p>In addition to the direct adjustment of single values in the interface (which are then written to the database), the “Import catch” and “Export to spreadsheet” buttons provide functionality to read and write values for all fisheries and time steps at once from an external [FRAMVSTemplate file], on sheets FRAMinput and FRAM_MSF. Note also the “clipboard copy” option in the upper left corner of the interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-retention" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-Retention</h2>
<p>Coho or Chinook non-retention (CNR) inputs represent any fishery (or portion of a fishery) that will be open for salmon fishing but requires release of Coho or Chinook. Differences in the input menu screens for Coho and Chinook reflect the different methodologies.</p>
<p>For Chinook, similar to other inputs, control flag values (flags 1 – 4) determine the mode by which non-retention impacts are calculated, with different modes requiring various additional parameter values (Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4) (definitions displayed in the lower left of the interface window). Typically, only flag 3 (Legal/Sublegal Encounters) or flag 4 (Total Encounters) are used. Encounters for Puget Sound marine sport fisheries can be automatically updated using the [Automate Pass 1 Pass 2] button on the FRAM <a href="#utilities">Utilities</a> menu.</p>
<p>For Coho, non-retention mortality is calculated outside of the model and entered as the total number of dead fish resulting from the non-retention portion of a fishery/time-step. Typically, the value is derived from a historic level of landed or encountered coho and then applying both a release mortality rate and a drop-off mortality rate to that historic level, and summing the two types of mortalities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the individual values can be altered (and consequently saved to the run in the database) and there is also a button to “Zero All Fields”. In addition, the interface provides options to “Import NonRetention” and “Export to Spreadsheet” all fishery/time steps from the external FRAMVSTemplate file (sheet FRAM_CNR).</p>
<p>Note many fishery/time-step cells are filled with asterisks (****) designating a lack of base period information to model that stratum. If a fishery now operates in one of those time steps the input (and impacts) need to be combined with an adjacent fishery or time step.</p>

<h2>Size Limits (Chinook)</h2>
<p>The minimum length of legal landed catch is defined per-fishery and time-step. This is relevant for multi-aged Chinook modeling where the minimum retention size limit (unit = fork length in millimeters) may vary annually, by fishery and/or by time-step. Generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>troll fisheries often require larger fish than sport in the same location and time</li>
<li>winter limits are often smaller</li>

<h1>Save Model Run Inputs</h1>

<p>Once the user has modified stock or fishery inputs from the main input menu and clicked the “Exit” button to return to the FRAM Main Menu, the “Save Model Run Inputs” button should be selected. This step writes the working set of input parameters to each of the appropriate project database tables for the model run.</p>
<p>If you select the button, a message “No input values have changed. No action taken.” may appear if there have been no changes made.</p>
<p>However, if changes have been made but are only currently in memory, then several options will appear: “Replace Current Model Run” or “Save NEW Model Run”, and a “Cancel Save” button to return to the Main Menu.</p>
<p>If the “Replace Current Model Run” is selected, then any changes will overwrite the values in the project database for the model run shown at the bottom of the application window. Upon completion, the program will return to the Main Menu with the same model run name.</p>
<p>If the “Save NEW Model Run” button is selected, then the program will display the <a href="#copy-model-run">Copy model run</a> screen to allow entry of a new run name, run title, run year, comments on changes, etc. This process will generate a separate model run in the project database that includes the model input changes. By default, FRAM will name a new model run “COPY OF ……” the currently selected model run name. After clicking “OK – Done”, the program will complete the database write and return to the Main Menu with the new model run selected.</p>

<h1>Run Model</h1>
<p>This menu item initiates a model run - applying the current parameters and input values to produce new output values.</p>
<p>The application monitors when a user may have altered values relative to the currently loaded run. If “Run Model” is selected when input values have changed but have not yet been saved to the project database tables associated with the model run, then a pop-up window will prompt with the message “Input Values Have Been Changed! Changes Must be Saved before Running Model!!! Save Current Model Run???”.</p>
<p>If you select “Yes” and save your model inputs by replacing the current model run or creating a new model run, then when you click “Run Model” from the Main Menu, it will present the Model Run Specifications menu.</p>
<p>If you select the “No”, a message will warn you “Please be aware that the OUTPUT for this model run cannot be duplicated without saving your INPUT values.” If you click “OK”, then it will present the Model Run Specifications menu.</p>
<p>The forwards FRAM Model Run Specifications menu screens include several optional checkboxes which differ by species. The sections below describe these in more detail.</p>
<p>The “Select TAMM” button is used to navigate to and select an associated [TAMM] file (see also [Running FRAM with TAMM]). Note that when a model run with a TAMM begins, the prompt “Do you want to save TAMM Transfer Values into TAMM spreadsheet?” will apear. Choosing “Yes” will ensure [TAMX] values are updated. After run completion, the TAMM file used will include updated values and be open, though possibly in the background. <strong>Make sure to navigate to the open TAMM file and save it to retain the modeled values.</strong></p>
<p>Once the model run is complete, the model run name may have been updated with a prefix in the list of model runs within a database (Main Menu – Select Model Run to see list). For coho, the prefix “bc-“ is added when the default calculations for MSF bias correction have been used in a model run. For Chinook, the prefix “SLC-“ is added when the default calculations for size limit fix have been used in a model run.</p>

<div id="run-coastal-iterations" class="section level3">
<h3>Run coastal iterations</h3>
<p>Beginning with the 2017 preseason, FRAM was updated to automate a previously manual process of iterating Washington coastal terminal fishery inputs between TAMM and FRAM. The fishery inputs are read into FRAM from a formatted table on TAMM sheet WACoastTerminal (starting row 150, cells in green highlight, as landed catch; flag 2 = fishery quota) and iterated to ± 1 fish.</p>
<p>When working with a Coho project database, from the main menu “Run Model” button, the Model Run Specifications screen requires you to select the TAMM file associated with the model run and then select the checkbox for “Run Coastal Iterations” before clicking the “RUN Model” button to complete the process.</p>
<p>By default, this checkbox should be used/checked with all preseason Coho model runs, as Washington coastal iterations are needed every time a terminal area’s fishery structure changes or when a pre-terminal FRAM fishery changes the ocean escapement value.</p>
<p>In general, FRAM produces an ocean escapement for each Washington coastal coho stock and regional technical staff utilize those values in regional terminal harvest management models. The local stock-specific harvest rates from the regional terminal models are then utilized in the WACoastTerminal sheet of the TAMM and in subsequent calculations. These results differ from the base period exploitation rates used in FRAM.<br />
However, FRAM is used with base period stock composition for associated impacts upon non-local stocks in terminal regional fisheries with “dip-ins” (i.e. fish which could be expected to return to their native systems if not harvested; not a stray).</p>
<p>Thus, the final results of stock impacts in Washington coastal terminal fisheries are a combination of regional specific local stock impacts and those produced by the FRAM and its base period.</p>
</div>
<div id="run-without-msf-bias-correction" class="section level3">
<h3>Run without MSF bias correction</h3>
<p>By default, a mark-selective fishery bias correction factor is used in both preseason and post-season Coho FRAM modeling. The MSF bias correction in FRAM was a result of demonstrating that unmarked mortalities were underestimated due to multiple encounter bias from mark-selective fisheries <span class="citation">[@conrad2010]</span> and the desire to incorporate bias-corrected equations into FRAM <span class="citation">[@conrad2011, @ahb2012]</span>.</p>
<p>The checkbox “Run w/o MSF Bias Correction” should not be checked except in unusual circumstances or for troubleshooting purposes. As a result of the MSF bias correction factor calculations in FRAM, the program will often prompt the user with a warning that a particular stock has exceeded 100% ER (i.e. the stock size has gone negative in the model and at what point). This is often helpful in troubleshooting issues with fishery inputs.</p>

<p>Prior to 2007, FRAM combined fishery impacts from Areas 10 and 11 sport for the purpose of TAMX reporting. These fisheries are now separated in TAMX. Loading a current TAMX into a pre-2007 TAMM will result in line offsets that create errors.</p>

<p>Selecting this button when running FRAM with TAMM will not load TAMI values into FRAM, yet load TAMX output into TAMM. Existing FRAM terminal fishery values will be used to run FRAM. TAMM iterations will not be performed.</p>
<p>This button is rarely used, but can be a helpful shortcut when needing TAMM output, but TAMM terminal fishery inputs are not available. Compiling information for a long time series of post-season runs is an example of where this procedure may be beneficial. TAMM consolidates a multitude of terminal fishery inputs into just a few key TAMI values. These fewer, consolidated values are easier to compile than the detailed TAMM inputs (e.g., avoiding splitting post-season catches into regulation periods for sockeye, coho, chum etc.). Terminal fishery catches can be directly entered into FRAM. As long as TAMM contains updated terminal run sizes and freshwater inputs, TAMX output will be compatible with the TAMM it is loaded into.</p>

<div id="chinook-brood-year-aeq-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Chinook Brood Year AEQ Report</h3>
<p>Selecting this check box produces a brood year exploitation rate report called “BY-Cohort-Compare-FramVS.txt” located in the same directory as the FRAM database.</p>
<p>Brood year calculations subject the forecast abundance of an age to the current fishing year’s fishery inputs, calculate the resulting escapement as well as the number of fish remaining in the ocean and advance to the next age. The resulting age+1 is then also subjected to the same fishery inputs, until age 5 is reached. Thus the same fishery inputs are used for all four ages (2-5) resulting from a brood year. FRAM algorithms are applied to each age class in forward and reverse mode.</p>
<p>Note that, in contrast, a “true” brood year run would apply fishery inputs from the first year to age 2s, compute the resulting age 3s, apply fishery inputs from year+1 to these age 3s, compute the resulting age 4s, apply fishery inputs from year+2 to these age 4s, compute the resulting age 5s, and finally apply fishery inputs from year+3 to the age 5s.</p>
<p>Forward and reverse brood year computations by age; i.e. calculate age 2 starting cohort for age 3 forecast with reverse calculations, then calculate age 4 and 5 starting cohort with forward calculations.</p>

<div id="no-size-limit-fix" class="section level3">
<h3>No size limit fix</h3>
<p>FRAM allows for evaluations of the effect of changes in minimum size limit regulations to fishery catches and stock impacts. Size limits are altered infrequently in hook and line salmon fisheries. FRAM’s original size limit evaluation algorithms were problematic, because they resulted in changes to the number of total encounters with each size limit change. FRAM uses different rates to model encounters of legal and sublegal fish. These rates are computed during the calibration process and are based on landed catch and encounter information during base period years (currently brood years 2005-2008).</p>
<p>When size limits are modeled in FRAM, each fish smaller than the size limit is treated as a sublegal fish. Sublegal encounter rates are used to compute releases and release mortalities. Conversely, each fish larger than the size limit is deemed legal and legal encounter rates are used to estimate catch as well as releases and release mortalities in mark selective fisheries. As the size limit is changed, a portion of the population (with sizes between the old and the new size limit) that previously received a sublegal encounter rate will receive a legal encounter rate or vice versa. Because legal and sublegal encounter rates are not the same for the same stock and age, this leads to the total number of computed encounters varying with size limits, an incorrect outcome, if effort remains constant.</p>
<p>FRAM incorporates corrected equations that hold total encounters constant, regardless of the modeled size limit (<span class="citation">@ahb2013</span>, <span class="citation">@mchugh2015</span>, <span class="citation">@johnson2015</span>).</p>
<p>In a first round of evaluations, FRAM computes sublegal encounters using sublegal/legal ratios based on recent field data (i.e., length-frequency data for Chinook encounters in recreational test fisheries). These ratios are updated each year in the [Project database tables] “SLRatio”. To produce the desired sublegal encounters, FRAM iteratively calculates an “Encounter Rate Adjustment” for each fishery and time step, such that sublegal encounters summed over stocks and ages within a fishery and time step produce the target sublegal/legal ratios, given legal sized, landed catch inputs (fishery scalers or quotas). Once run, “Encounter Rate Adjustments” are stored in the “RunEncounterRateAdjustment” column of the “SLRatio” table.</p>
<p>Size limit changes are evaluated with Van Bertalanffy growth equations. These equations determine the proportion legal and or/sublegal by stock and age under desired size limit regulations. The model calculates the legal and sublegal encounters for both the original and new minimum size limit and then adjust the differences so that total encounters remain constant.</p>
<p>When the new size limit is less than the base-period size limit, the difference in sublegal encounters between the base size-limit and the new size-limit becomes landed catch that is added to the calculated landed catch evaluated at the base-period size limit. Encounters are calculated by dividing the encounter estimates by the sublegal release mortality rate.</p>
<p>Conversely, when the new size limit is greater than the base-period size limit, the difference in landed catch between the new size limit and the base-period size limit becomes sublegal encounters. This encounter difference is added to the calculated sublegal encounters from the base-period size limit to get total sublegal encounter mortality.</p>
<p><strong>When this button is checked</strong>, FRAM will not automatically update the encounter rate adjustments needed to achieve desired sublegal/legal ratios and instead use the encounter rate adjustments in the existing model run. FRAM will also revert to original size limit evaluation algorithms, where total encounters can fluctuate when size limits are changed.</p>
<p>If unsure, please leave this button unchecked (default), as the default setting will produce the most accurate run. However, there are several reasons to check the “No-Size-Limit-Fix” button:</p>
<ul>
<li>To speed up the run, as sublegal encounter iterations, especially when performed with TAMM, can be very time consuming. However, for correct results, the following assumptions need to be met:
<ul>
<li>“Encounter Rate Adjustments” were updated during a previous model run and will result in desired sublegal/legal ratios (see Background paragraph above).</li>
<li>The sublegal/legal ratios in the database were computed for the same size limits that exist in the current model run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For backwards compatibility to reproduce an “old-style” (pre 2013) run</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="cohort-t4-pre-2012-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>Cohort T4 pre 2012 Processing</h3>
<p>This button exists for backwards compatibility reasons. Prior to 2012, FRAM would not have reused time step 1 forecasts in time step 4 for ages with a missing “age minus 1” abundance. Chinook age up in time step 4; i.e. an age 2 fish becomes an age 3 fish, an age 3 fish turns age 4, etc. Previously, if a stock was not expected to return at a certain age, time 4 of age+1 would have been left blank. Since 2012, for these stocks, time step 4 of a given age reuses the time step 1 abundance of the same age.</p>

</div>
<div id="sl-ratio-update" class="section level3">
<h3>S:L ratio update</h3>
<p>Since 2014, FRAM computes sublegal encounters using sublegal/legal ratios (<span class="citation">@mchugh2015</span>, <span class="citation">@johnson2015</span>). These ratios are usually derived from recent field data (i.e., length-frequency data for Chinook encounters in recreational test fisheries) and updated annually in the “SLRatio” table of FRAM’s ACCESS database. To produce the desired sublegal encounters, FRAM iteratively calculates an “Encounter Rate Adjustment” for each fishery and time step such that sublegal encounters summed over stocks and ages within a fishery and time step produce the target sublegal/legal ratios, given legal sized landed catch inputs (fishery scalers or quotas). Once run, “Encounter Rate Adjustments” are stored in the “RunEncounterRateAdjustment” column of the “SLRatio” table.</p>
<p>The “S:L Ratio Update” button is a relic from pre-2019 FRAM.exe releases. The new FRAM default (leave “No Size Limit Fix” button unchecked) automatically updates Encounter Rate Adjustments with each model run in the course of computing size limit corrected legal and sublegal encounters.</p>
<p>When this button is clicked, FRAM will calculate “Encounter Rate Adjustments” for each fishery and time step such that sublegal encounters summed over stocks and ages within a fishery and time step produce the target sublegal/legal ratios. These ratios are then stores in the “RunEncounterRateAdjustment” column of the “SLRatio” table.</p>
<p>A message box will appear when clicking the “S:L Ratio Update” button.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_adv_slratio.png" width="70%" /></p>
<p>The user then has the option to check “Load TargetRatio from spreadsheet” box before clicking the “Initialize” button. This brings up a file selection dialog box. Choose the file with the desired sublegal/legal ratios. The file will most likely have “SL Ratios…” in the title and contain a tab called “SLRatioImport”. If the ratios are already loaded, leave this box unchecked. As soon as the ratios are loaded in the database, within a few seconds of clicking “Initialize”, FRAM’s “Run-Menu” will appear. Select the “Run Model” button to run FRAM as usual.</p>
<p>Since “Encounter Rate Adjustments” are automatically updated in the default mode, selecting this option only makes sense in combination with clicking the “No Size Limit Fix” button. This results in a model run with updated “Encounter Rate Adjustments”, but old size limit evaluations. Doing so is only advisable if the user is sure that size limits in the current model run are compatible with the sublegal/legal ratios in the database. One other reason to select the “S:L Ratio Update” button is the option to programmatically load target sublegal/legal ratios from an Excel workbook as described above.</p>

<div id="backwards-fram" class="section level1">
<h1>Backwards FRAM</h1>
<p>“Forward” FRAM model runs begin from a forecasted “pre-fishing” cohort and then apportion fishery impacts to the model stocks through the species-specific time steps. This conceptually parallels the observed seasonal progression of salmon returning to spawning grounds and release areas.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast, a “backward” FRAM (bkFRAM) model run combines observed terminal run size and escapement values with observed catch values to iteratively derive a set of recruit scalers, such that those scalers produce a starting cohort capable of producing the known catch and escapement. Starting cohorts are initial FRAM run sizes before natural mortality, fishing mortality, and maturation. For Chinook, bkFRAM calculates age 3 to 5 starting cohorts, and for Coho, starting cohorts are in units of January Age 3 fish. This process is conceptually related to traditional “run reconstruction” approaches.</p>
<p>These runs play several important roles.</p>
<p>During the preseason planning process, Chinook forecasts are commonly reported in terms of terminal run size. Thus, the initial preseason Chinook model run is actually a backwards model run that enables the reconstruction of a starting cohort for all subsequent preseason modeling. This “average run” is a backwards Chinook FRAM run that targets the new season’s terminal return forecasts (by stock) in the context of fishery parameters averaged from recent observed years.</p>
<p>Following completion of a fishing year, a post-season backwards run is performed to incorporate the most current representation of what actually happened. Note that in addition to the new year, updates to the data characterizing older years may also be integrated during this process. The Pacific Salmon Commission’s Coho Technical Committee (CoTC) conducts post-season Coho model runs to evaluate annual Pacific Salmon Treaty obligations. The salmon co-managers (Washington Treaty Tribes and WDFW) conduct post-season Chinook model runs, which can be found on their website at: <a href="https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/fram-model-runs/post-season-fram-modeling/" class="uri">https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/fram-model-runs/post-season-fram-modeling/</a></p>
<p>BkFRAM can be run for an individual stock or a combination of stocks (including all stocks). It requires a “seed” run that contains desired fishery impacts (observed values for post-season runs or recent year average values for pre-season runs). The seed run will also contain starting cohorts for stocks where this parameter is known; i.e. the forecast is already in starting cohort units rather than terminal run size units.</p>
<p>BkFRAM can run in three modes. The mode is selected using a flag in the input process. Flags are stock-specific, allowing all three flags (values = 0,1,2) to be used in a single bkFRAM model run.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mode 0 (flag 0): This mode does not use bkFRAM to find starting stock scalars. Instead, FRAM uses the starting cohort values from the existing “StockRecruit” table in the project database.</p></li>
<li><p>Mode 1 (flag 1): This mode uses an algorithm to iteratively adjust stock recruit scalars until the target abundance is achieved. Target abundances are adipose mark specific. This method is used when the mark rate of a stock is known.</p></li>
<li><p>Mode 2 (flag 2): This mode is selected when target mark rates are unavailable. Algorithms from mode 1 are used to find the starting stock recruit scalars that result in the combined target abundance (marked and unmarked components). The program will then apply mark rates derived from the existing “StockRecruit” table to split starting cohorts into marked and unmarked components.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next, target abundance values must be set if they are not already. Selecting the ‘Target Escapements” button brings up the Target Escapements for Backwards FRAM menu, which has a slightly different layout for Chinook and Coho.</p>
</div>
<div id="target-escapements-for-chinook" class="section level2">
<h2>Target escapements for Chinook</h2>
<p>The values for the FRAM calculations to target must be provided by stock, mark status, and age, in conjunction with a control flag. The effects of flag values are displayed on screen, with <code>0</code> meaning the value is not used, <code>1</code> it is used, and <code>2</code> that it is intended to be automatically split into marked and unmarked components. A flag value of <code>3</code> is deprecated but allowed for legacy compatibility.</p>
<p>When terminal run size is known for a stock by age and mark status, these can be entered with a flag of “1” in the correspondingly labeled cells. If the mark rate is unknown, enter the combined (marked plus unmarked) abundance in the “TOTAL” row and flag as “2” (i.e. will use mark rates from “seed run”). If you do not wish to overwrite existing cohort sizes for a stock, flag relevant row(s) (Total, Marked, Unmarked) as “0”.</p>
<p>While the FRAM interface enables editing individual values, the “Import Escapements” option allows an “all-at-once” update via the selection of an MS Excel template file containing model inputs compiled outside of FRAM.

<p>The following table represents which Chinook FRAM fisheries (by FisheryID numeric values and generic titles) and time steps (horizontal) are included in the run size definition of each stock (by StockID numeric values and StockName) (vertical). A “yes” denotes that the landed catch of ages 3-5 Chinook in fishery and time steps are added to the age 3-5 run to the river (escapement + freshwater catch). T1 equals October-April time step, T2 equals May-June time step, and T3 equals July-September time step</p>

<div id="target-escapements-for-coho" class="section level2">
<h2>Target escapements for Coho</h2>
<p>Enter target escapements by stock and mark status and flag as “1” in the correspondingly labeled cells. Coho escapement values should exclude jacks (age 2), as coho are assumed to be age 3 in the FRAM model framework. If the mark rate is unknown, enter the combined (marked plus unmarked) escapement in either the marked or unmarked stock row and flag as “2” (will use mark rates from “seed run”). If you do not wish to overwrite exisiting cohort sizes for a stock, flag relevant row(s) (Marked, Unmarked) as “0”.</p>
<p>Escapement values can also be loaded from a MS Excel template file designed for model inputs (“CohoFRAMInputTemplate….xls”) by selecting the “Import Escapements” button and then locating and selecting the file with the desired values. The template file workbook needs to contain a worksheet tab called “FRAMEscapeV2”, and the user may need to unhide it within the template. The escapement values within the worksheet are organized as rows by stock and mark status and columns per year. A column exists for every year desired for updating model inputs. The program will request a single ‘Year’ to load from the Excel worksheet.</p>
<p>Escapement values can be also be exported by selecting the “Export to Spreadsheet” button on the Target Escapements for Backwards FRAM menu using the same workbook template file needed for importing. The program will also request the ‘Year’ of data to export.</p>
<p>Once the input values are updated, select “OK - Done” to return to the Backwards FRAM Run Menu to “Start Iterations”.</p>
</div>
<div id="start-iterations" class="section level2">
<h2>Start iterations</h2>
<p>With target escapements entered, the number of desired iterations can be selected and then “Start Iterations” clicked. The default number of iterations is 99. This number will rarely be reached, as iterations automatically terminate when the convergence criteria is met (run size within 1 fish of target).</p>
<p>For Coho, selecting the “Run without MSF Bias Correction (if checked)” button will process the backwards run without the MSF Bias Correction factor applied. By default, the MSF Bias Correction is applied during preseason forward Coho FRAM modeling and thus it is also by default applied during backward FRAM. Thus, this box is most commonly left unchecked.</p>
<p>For Chinook, selecting the “Age 2 from 3” box will cause the program to process using fishing year (FY) age 2 from 3 abundances (e.g., the recruit scaler for age 3s will be used for age 2s). This corresponds to the preseason mode of operation. After selecting “Start Iterations”, a prompt requires the user to select whether or not to use TAMI catches for the run. Choosing “yes” is appropriate if the correct TAMI fishery catches (e.g., 7BCD net) are not yet loaded into FRAM. Conversely, “no” will skip this step when the FRAM run already has the correct TAMI catches stored (i.e, because FRAM has already been run forward with the correct TAMM and TAMI catches are automatically saved into the FRAM database).</p>
</div>
<div id="view-and-save-bkfram-results" class="section level2">
<h2>View and save BkFRAM results</h2>
<p>After iterations are complete, the program returns a result screen (with slightly different layouts for Chinook and Coho) which lists target escapements, resulting BkFRAM escapements, and new stock recruit scalers side by side in order to assess whether values have sufficiently converged.</p>

For Chinook, these values can be displayed summed or broken out by age per fishery (i.e., all age 3 catch within fishery N). Results may also be displayed as a zero value for strata in which base period data are unavailable. In other screen reports, these strata are often denoted with “****”.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Landed Catch</code> designates fish that are caught and retained</li>
<li><code>NonRetention</code> includes incidental mortalities from mark-selective fisheries and/or other fisheries not targeting Chinook or coho (e.g., pink or chum salmon, test fishing, etc.)</li>
<li><code>Shakers</code> accounts for non-landed mortalities from sub-legal encounters</li>
<li><code>Dropoff</code> (also net drop out) represents mortality from encounters in which the fish is never observed (i.e., “the one that got away”)</li>
<li><code>TotalMortality</code> is the sum of these components</li>
<li>For Chinook, <code>AEQ-Total Mort</code> designates the “adult equivalent” translation of the total mortality, reflecting an age-based estimate of the fish that could have actually survived to return to spawn given subsequent years of fishing and non-fishing related impacts (e.g., younger fish that are killed due to fishing in year Y would not necessarily have survived to return in a later year Y+t, even in the absence of year Y’s fishing)</li>

<h3>Stock mortality reports</h3>
<p>The mortality types described above can also be viewed by fishery and time step for an individual stock or a selected sub-set of stocks. After selecting this report, a menu allows selection of a single stock or multiple stocks using Control+Click. After the desired stocks are highlighted, click “OK – Done” to view the report. The fishery mortality data types will be summarized for all stocks selected.</p>

</div>
<div id="population-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Population statistics</h3>
<p>The “popstat” report is regularly used for Chinook, as it clearly illustrates changes through the major FRAM processing steps that take a stock from starting cohort to escapement. It presents the cohort trajectory through time steps for each stock, broken out by age for Chinook. The columns describe the progression through time of the starting cohort through natural mortality, pre-terminal fisheries, maturation, and terminal fisheries to escapement. For Chinook, note that FRAM currently calculates “marine escapement” while “spawning escapement” is handled within [TAMM].</p>
<p>For Chinook the report data represent by time step: starting cohort by age (T#-StartCoh), cohort after natural mortality (T#-postNM), cohort after pre-terminal fisheries (T#-postPT), mature cohort resulting from stock-specific maturity age parameters as provided by the base period (T#-Mat), escapement of the mature cohort remaining after FRAM’s set of terminal fisheries (T#-Esc).</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_output_screenrpt_popstatchin.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>For Coho the report data represent by time step: starting cohort (T#-Coht), cohort after natural mortality and pre-terminal fisheries (T#-Rem), mature cohort in time step 5 (Oct-Dec) only (Mature), and escapement of the mature cohort remaining after terminal and freshwater fisheries (Escape; i.e. spawner escapement).</p>

</div>
<div id="mark-selective-fishery-reports" class="section level3">
<h3>Mark-Selective Fishery Reports</h3>
<p>This option generates detailed accounting of stock-specific mortality for a selected mark-selective fishery and time step. All fisheries/time-steps flagged as mark-selective in a particular model run will be available in the drop-down menu on the upper left. Once a selection is made, the values for each stock impacted in that fishery/time-step are presented. Values for unmarked and marked components include: handled fish, catch mortality, non-retention mortality, drop-off mortality, and for Chinook only will include sub-legal mortality.</p>
<p>Additionally, the red “WDFW MSF Report” button transfers Chinook information related to landings, encounters, and mortalities aggregated across all stocks to an external Excel spreadsheet. The button is not available for Coho modeling.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_output_screenrpt_msfrpt.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="fishery-stock-composition-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Fishery stock composition report</h3>
<p>After selection of a single fishery from the drop-down menu, this report displays the percentage of each stock within the total mortality for each time step. Only those stocks impacted by the fishery will be displayed (i.e. a different set of stocks can be displayed for each fishery). Note: for Chinook fisheries without a 100% model stock proportion, percentages within this report only represent the modeled portion of the catch.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_output_screenrpt_stockcomp.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="stock-impacts-per-1000" class="section level3">
<h3>Stock impacts per 1000</h3>
<p>This normalized view of stock-specific total mortality impacts for each fishery and time step offers another perspective on relative differences. This report demonstrates the stock contribution (in numbers of non-AEQ fish) to a hypothetical total mortality of 1,000 fish in each fishery/time step. Only a single stock component can be selected (i.e. only the Skookum Creek Hatchery Marked stock can be viewed and a separate selection would be necessary to see the results for the Skookum Creek Hatchery Unmarked stock).</p>

<div id="report-drivers" class="section level2">
<h2>Report Drivers</h2>
<p>Report drivers generate 14 pre-formatted output report types using unique instructions found in the report driver. Many of these reports are also available as screen reports or found in FRAM output to TAMM files. A report driver is species-specific, tied to a unique base period for parameters, and contains a header with metadata. The output reports are given a .PRN file extension and can be opened with a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad. The actual report drivers, with instructions on what to include, are stored in the MS Access project database table ReportDriver.</p>
<p>From the main menu, select “Output/Results”, “Report Driver File”, to get to the report driver file options. The most straightforward step is to “Select Driver” from the available report drivers already in the project database table ReportDriver. Click the checkbox next to one from the list and you will be re-directed back to the driver file options menu. Next, click the “Run Reports” button to name and save the output PRN file. Once you click save from the prompt, the output PRN file is generated and ready to view. The “Edit Report Driver” option is no longer functional in updated versions of FRAM and thus a new report driver must be created to make changes from an old one. Changes to a report driver need to be made in the project database table ReportDriver.</p>
<p>Many FRAM databases include various previously created custom report drivers. To create a new report driver, select “Output/Results”, “Report Driver File”, “Create Report Driver”. Select the desired report from the 14 available options and specify parameters for customization from the selection boxes. A good example of a unique, customizable report is the “Terminal Run Summary”. This report allows the user to specify fisheries and time steps for inclusion in the terminal run definition of selected stocks. When prompted, save the driver. The new driver will then appear in the “Select Driver” report selection box. To produce output, select the new driver and click “Run Report”.</p>

<div id="edit-model-run-info" class="section level2">
<h2>Edit model run info</h2>
<p>Selecting this option provides an interface to alter some of the metadata associated with an existing run, particularly the name, title, year and comments (stored in <code>RunID</code> table in the database [Lookups]). Best practices encourage entering careful, comprehensive notes for future reference.</p>
<p>When changes are cumulative across numerous runs, such as in a preseason or “forward” context, comments may often refer to prior runs for ease of reading (i.e., “started with run N, changed X, Y, and Z”). Preseason model runs often start with the beginning model run notes and add sequentially above those as the preseason progresses, so that the newest changes describing the run are at the top for easy viewing. The Comments field cannot be deleted and left blank or FRAM will throw an error message. If this happens, click “Quit” and re-try.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_edit_info.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="copy-model-run" class="section level2">
<h2>Copy model run</h2>
<p>As shown in the [Make a run copy] section of [A basic forward run], this option conveniently provides the starting point for further work to examine scenarios for the FRAM management units. Recall that a given “run” is spread across numerous tables in a project database and involves many rows within some tables. Consequently, this utility helps save time and avoid error by ensuring that all necessary steps to create a new model run are completed. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It is common practice to copy an existing run, re-name it something new, make input changes, and generate updated model results from the new run.</p>
<p>Having reached the “NEW Copied Recordset Information” screen, specify an informative <code>RunName</code> and <code>RunTitle</code> in the respective fields. In addition, the free-text “Comments” field is an important place to document the planned changes, the original run it is based on, the date a change was made and by whom, etc. This is also easily updated later with any further changes (see <a href="#edit-model-run-info">Edit model run info</a>). After entering a good description of what will change, click “Ok - done” to complete the process and return to the FRAM utilities menu, with the newly copied run loaded into memory. <em>Note that this step involves writing to disk and may take a few seconds - no need to panic if FRAM hangs momentarily.</em></p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_copy_run.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="delete-model-run" class="section level2">
<h2>Delete model run</h2>
<p><strong>Note that this process cannot be reversed. If it is necessary to remove a run from a database while preserving it for later use, then creating a model run transfer is likely a good option.</strong></p>
<p>This option provides a convenient means to comprehensively remove one or several runs from a database. Selecting the “Delete Model Run” button prompts a screen listing available runs. After selecting a single model run name in the list, a confirmation prompt again displays what will be removed. If you are certain you wish to delete the model run, click “Yes” - or - click “No” to return to the FRAM Utilities menu. The currently active model run cannot be deleted with this utility, and attempting to do so will produce an error prompt. Simply return to the main menu, select a different run, and re-try the deletion. (Note it is also possible to delete runs directly from the main model selection window.)</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_del_error.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>To remove and delete more than one model run from a project database, select the “Delete Model Run” button and then the “Delete multiple runs” button found at the lower right (not the list of runs in the interface). This will then prompt the user with a separate window for Delete Multiple Model Runs, with another list of model runs in the project database. In this separate window, the user checks the boxes next to individual model run names and once multiple runs (or even a single run) have been checked, click the “Delete Selection Done” button. There will be no additional confirmation prompt displayed, rather the model runs will be deleted.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_del_mult.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="transfer-model-runs" class="section level2">
<h2>Transfer model runs</h2>
<p>Model run transfer files, which are typically indicated as such by name, contain only portions of a subset of [Project database tables]. They enable sharing the relevant values for a single run without transmitting an entire [Project database].</p>
<p>Clicking the “Transfer Model Runs” button in FRAM Utilities will prompt a message box “Please select the Transfer Database” and the user clicks “OK”. At that point, a file selection dialogue appears for a “template” model run transfer .mdb file into which the transferred values will be written. Be sure to utilize a “blank” template model run transfer file, or any model runs will be added to those that are already stored in the file. The current version of this template is generally provided on the <a href="https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/fram-model-runs/pre-season-fram-model-files/annual-pre-season-model-files/">Fisheries Services</a> site.</p>
<p>After an appropriate template is chosen, a “Model Run TRANSFER Selections” window appears with the list of available model runs in the project database. When the desired run or multiple runs (Cntl+click) are highlighted in the interface list and the “Transfer Selection Done” button is clicked, the application will prompt for a new file name. After entering an informative name, the new values are written into the template and the user returns to the FRAM Utilities submenu.</p>
<p><em>Note that the actual file creation may take a few seconds during writes to disk.</em></p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_make_transfer.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="get-model-run-transfers" class="section level2">
<h2>Get model run transfers</h2>
<p>Complementing a transfer write out, this option reads in one or several runs from an existing model run transfer file. The straightforward process simply involves clicking the “Get Model Run Transfers” button, selecting the desired model run transfer file, clicking “Open”, and waiting for the application to complete the read and subsequent write of values into the project database. Then exit out of the FRAM utilities menu, and click the “Select Model Run” button on the main menu to load a newly transferred run, which should be found at the end of the available list.</p>
<p>Note that inadvertently reading in a duplicative run should not generally cause great harm, as the “new” run will be assigned whatever <code>RunID</code> is incrementally next and will not overwrite existing elements of the project database.</p>
</div>
<div id="read-old-base-period" class="section level2">
<h2>Read old base period</h2>
<p>Prior to 2011, base period data were stored in a text file with a <code>.out</code> extension, commonly referred to as outfiles. These historic outfiles are associated with <code>*.cmd</code> “command files”. The outfile information is equivalent to data stored in FRAM [Project database tables] containing a ‘BaseID’ field; i.e base period exploitation rates, maturation rates, growth functions, etc.</p>
<p>The “Read Old Base Period” utility reads the outfile and places the information in the relevant model run Access database tables; i.e. base period exploitation rates are stored in the “BaseExploitationRate” table.</p>
<p>However, importing an old model run (command file) and associated outfile into a modern FRAM database can be problematic, as some of the existing tables need to be compatible with the old data. The existing “Stock” table in the database has to include the stock version of the old outfile; i.e. version 1 for the old 76 stock structure of Chinook. Ideally, the “ChinookBaseSizeLimit” table should contain size limits from the old base period. Since the FRAM Access database currently only accommodates size limits from one base period, it is not advisable to load runs from more than one base period.</p>
<p>Generally, the chance of run errors increases significantly with older model runs (command file) and the associated base period (outfile). Nevertheless, being able to quickly produce output summaries through Access queries is a huge advantage over the old method of retrieving output through driver files. It is highly advisable to compare TAMX output from the original run with output produced using the current version of FRAM before taking advantage of this functionality.</p>
<p>To import an old base period into a FRAM database, select “Utilities”, “Read Old Base Period”, pick the desired outfile and then press “Yes” when prompted to confirm that the base period is for Chinook.</p>
</div>
<div id="deletetransferget-base-period" class="section level2">
<h2>Delete/Transfer/Get base period</h2>
<p>Much as the above delete, transfer and get model run functions manipulate multiple tables throughout the project database, these options provide a similar means to handle entire base periods. Not all project databases will have more than one set of base period parameters, but these functions are important when this is the case.</p>
<p><strong>Until additional features are implemented for Chinook, a single base period should be utilized in a project database. This is due to some tables in the project database containing values unique to an individual base period, but the table is not tied to a unique BaseID. Once they are tied to a unique BaseID, then more than one base period can be utilized in a Chinook project database. Please consult with a lead FRAM modeler if you need assistance.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="compute-2s-from-3s-chin" class="section level2">
<h2>Compute 2s from 3s (Chin)</h2>
<p>The abundances of 2 year olds are often not forecasted. Selecting this button will result in FRAM calculating the starting cohort of age 2s as a function of the 3s; i.e. produce a recruit scaler of 2 year olds that roughly produces the age 3 starting cohort. This is desirable for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On average (over time), age 2 scalers should be of a magnitude that is related to age three abundance, because age 2 fish will mature to become age 3 fish.</p></li>
<li><p>In FRAM, age 2 fish will become age 3 fish in time 4. Having age 2 abundances that are incompatible with age 3 abundances can result in large and undesirable exploitation rate swings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting this utility, FRAM applies a constant to the 3 year old starting cohort to calculate the 2 year old cohort. This links the age 2 and 3 recruit scalers similarly as a cohort reconstruction would. Most constants are close to 1.0 resulting in new age 2 scalers that are almost identical to the age 3 scalers.</p>
<p>To compute age 2 starting scalers, after clicking the “Compute 2s From3s (Chin)” button, the following window will pop up.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_age2s3s.png" width="70%" /></p>
<p>After selecting “Yes” the “Save Model Run Input” screen will open, allowing selection of either “Replace Current Model Run” or “Save New Model Run”. These steps return the user to the “FRAM Utilities” menu. Age 2 recruit scalers have been updated and saved. If desired, this can be verified by opening the “Input Menu”, selecting <a href="#stock-recruits">Stock recruits</a> and examining the new age 2 scalers.</p>
</div>
<div id="read-old-cmd-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Read old CMD file</h2>
<p>Prior to 2011, annual FRAM inputs were stored in a text file with a <code>.cmd</code> extension, commonly referred to as command files. This information is equivalent to data stored in all FRAM Access database tables containing a ‘RunID’ field; i.e annual model run information. These text files were opened, modified, and run in FRAM version “FRAM555” or earlier. These versions of FRAM were coded in Visual Basic and preceded the currently in use FRAM Visual Studio.net versions with ADO.net database programming. The “Read Old CMD File” utility reads the command file and places the information in the relevant model run Access database tables; i.e. forecast information is stored in the “Cohort” table, retention fisheries inputs are placed in the “FisheryScalers” table. These historic command files are usually linked to old base periods which were stored in text files as well, with a *.out extension, commonly referred to as outfiles. Please refer to the Read Old Base Period paragraph for instructions on how to import an outfile into a FRAM Access database and [Linking a model run to a base period] for instructions.</p>
<p>To read an old model run into FRAM, first make sure the base period associated with the command file is loaded in the ACCESS database. The base period name can be found on the fifth line of the command file. Then, after clicking the “Read Old CMD File” button, navigate to and select the desired command file. Finally, select “yes” from the following pop up window.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_read_old_cmd.png" width="70%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="read-taaetrs-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Read TAA/ETRS file</h2>
<p>The “Read TAA/ETRS File” button in the FRAM Utilities is a seldom-used option to import old format CMD files (TAAETRSnum.txt) of the TAAETRSList table into the current project database structure.</p>
<p>The TAAETRSList table contains definitions (by unique TaaNum) for terminal run parameters, including stocks, fisheries, and time steps (only 4=Sept, 5=Oct-Dec). These terminal definitions are used in the TAMM (sheet Tami) and FRAM program code for certain algorithms. The TAAETRSList table is not tied to a specific model run (by unique RunID), and thus changes to this table over time will influence model run results from prior years if model runs are in the same project database, but had different terminal run parameter definitions each individual year. In addition, the TAAETRSList table is not included in a model run transfer file and thus definitions are not updated for each model run loaded into a project database.</p>
<p>Thus, the modeling strategy is to create new definitions within this table whenever a modification is necessary, rather than modifying current definitions. Thus, an older definition which matches an older TAMM will remain in the table for model run use (i.e #5). A newer definition will match a newer TAMM (i.e. #40). Both the older and newer values will remain in the same database table and thus multiple years of model runs can be utilized.</p>
<p>Starting in the preseason 2018 Coho project database, the TAAETRSList table has been updated to incorporate TaaNum definitions back through 2013, when the MS Access database structure was first implemented. Any TaaNum definition updates were also made in the starting TAMM files provided at that time.</p>
<p>Any necessary updates to the TAAETRSList table should be made at the beginning of the preseason salmon management process and incorporated in the starting MS Access project database file for coho FRAM. If updates are made to this table during the preseason negotiations, the NOF lead modeler will be responsible for notifying co-managers and ensuring the update is distributed.</p>
</div>
<div id="automate-pass-1-pass-2-chin" class="section level2">
<h2>Automate pass 1 pass 2 (Chin)</h2>
<p>This functionality was added in 2019 to automate a time consuming process to compute non-retention impacts in Puget Sound marine Chinook sport fisheries. In a first step (Pass 1), the non-retention fishery is modeled as “open” to Chinook retention. Output of sublegal and legal encounters from the ‘Pass-1-Run’ are subsequently modeled in the non-retention section of FRAM during the ‘Pass-2-Run’. Most Puget Sound marine Chinook sport fisheries are modeled in the [RunSheet (Chinook)], an Excel workbook that translates periods open to Chinook fishing into fishery effort scalers for FRAM.</p>
<p>Non-retention inputs should be updated when changes in abundances are significant enough to result in changes to encounters and/or when non-retention regulations are updated.</p>
<p>The utility requires an updated [RunSheet (Chinook)], with the naming convention “RunNNNN.xlsm” corresponding to the associated FRAM run number.</p>
<p>When selecting the “Automate Pass 1 Pass 2” button, FRAM will perform the following.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Model marine sport fisheries with the scalers located on the <code>Pass1Input</code> sheet of the workbook. These values reflect all marine sport fisheries (retention and non-retention) as open to retention. For this “wide-open” run, existing non-retention inputs stored in the Access database are set to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Paste landed catch and shaker estimates into the J:P range of the <code>CatchShakerPRN</code> sheet, whereby formulas convert these estimates into legal and sublegal encounters for the non-retention period only.</p></li>
<li><p>Update retention fisheries and flags (mark-selective, non-selective), as well as non-retention fisheries and flags with values on <code>Pass2Inputs</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After selecting this option, choose the desired RunSheet and press “Open”. FRAM will then prompt the user to save the updated values, and selecting “Yes” will open the “Save Model Run” menu.</p>
<p>After saving, FRAM will present the following message.</p>
<p><img src="images/fvs_utils_pass1pass2prompt.png" width="70%" /></p>
<p>After selecting “OK”, FRAM will open the <a href="#run-model">Run Model</a> menu. Once the run begins, the user interface disappears for a few minutes. FRAM then reappears when the run is finished.</p>
</div>
<div id="update-coweeman-sheets" class="section level2">
<h2>Update Coweeman sheets</h2>
<p>The Coweeman spreadsheet is an Excel workbook with abundance and exploitation rate summaries for Columbia River Chinook stocks. Columbia River salmon managers use it as a starting point for in-river models. The workbook also provides exploitation rate information for Lower Columbia River natural Chinook (LCN). This stock is represented by Coweeman hatchery tag codes in FRAM (hence the name of the spreadsheet). LCNs are ESA listed and can be a critical constraining stock for ocean salmon fisheries during the PFMC fishing season setting process. PFMC usually crafts three ocean fishery options bracketing possible ocean fisheries, with option 1 representing the “high” ocean option, 2 the “middle”, and 3 the “low”. Initially, all three options are modeled, but a single option is eventually selected.</p>
<p>All three options or just the final option can be loaded into the “Coweeman Spreadsheet”, an Excel workbook following the naming convention “CoweemanNNNN.xlsm”, where NNNN represents the associated FRAM run number. <strong>Note that the in-river LCN harvest rate in cell ‘PFMC-Option-1’!M8 needs to be updated.</strong></p>
<p>When selecting the “Update COWEEMAN Sheets” button, FRAM will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Perform brood year and fishing year calculations and summarize mortalities and abundances for Columbia River Chinook stocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Paste terminal run size and AEQ mortalities for marked, unmarked, and total Columbia River stocks into the tab corresponding to the fishing option selected.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After selecting “Update Coweeman sheets”, select the ocean option associated with the model run and then select the “Coweeman” spreadsheet and press open. After FRAM completes processing, the “Utilities” menu reappears. The updated Coweeman spreadsheet will be open in Excel with FRAM output loaded into the selected option. Save the workbook before closing.</p>
