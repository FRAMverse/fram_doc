Introduction</h1>

<div id="calibration-processes" class="section level1">
<h1>Calibration Processes</h1>
<p>The primary purpose of a calibration pass is to create a CWT recovery
data set that contains the number of CWT recoveries for stocks that were
tagged in the base period with a simulated number of CWT recoveries for
those stocks that were not tagged during the base period.</p>
<p>While it is possible, and perhaps even preferable, to conduct a
cohort reconstruction on a single stock basis, the original base period
calibration was conceived with the goal to reconstruct observed fishery
catches with the CWTs in-hand. Therefore, when summing CWT recoveries of
all stocks in a fishery, the expanded CWT catch should match the
observed catch. This introduces an element of realism into the
calibration, but also adds a significant amount of complexity to the
calibration process. In order to reconstruct the catch in a fishery,
several CWT expansions are necessary. All CWTs are initially expanded to
account for the sampling rate to estimate the number of CWTs that would
have been recovered had 100% of the catch and escapement been sampled.
The next expansion, the escapement expansion, accounts for the
relationship between CWTed releases and the total production.</p>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-pre-processing" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing</h2>
<p>To conduct a new base period calibration a vast amount of data is
compiled, processed, summarized, and analyzed. For CWT data this is
described in detail in the <a href="#FB">FRAMBuilder</a> paragraph. In
addition to CWT recovery data representing FRAM stocks, other key data
needed for development of the FRAM base period data set includes: 1)
stock abundances/recruitment to fisheries and escapements, 2) life
history information on maturation, age structure, natural mortality, and
growth rates, 3) fishery landings or effort indices, and 4) fishery
related mortality factors for fish released or fish encountering the
gear.</p>
<div id="analyzing-cwt-recovery-patterns" class="section level3">
<h3>1.1 Analyzing CWT Recovery Patterns</h3>
<p>CWT groups were identified representing 36 of the 38 FRAM stock units
(Table @ref(tab:Stocks)). White River and Strait of Juan de Fuca stocks
were not marked during the base period and thus in need of alternative
representation (see <a href="#WhiteOOB">White River</a> and <a
href="#JDF_Sur">JDF Surrogate</a> paragraphs for more information).
Marked CWT groups from hatcheries within a FRAM stock basin were used to
represent both hatchery and naturally produced fish. Selected CWT groups
were usually from “production” or “indicator” tag groups that were
considered similar to the stock ancestry and freshwater and marine life
history of the local natural stock. Estimated recoveries (observed
expanded by sampling rates) from these tag groups were downloaded from
the Regional Mark Information System of the Pacific States Marine
Fisheries Commission website. For each of the FRAM stock CWT group
aggregates, the “raw” recoveries were run through the program <a
href="#FB">FRAMBuilder</a> which maps the estimated age-specific CWT
recoveries to FRAM fishery and time strata. These mapped CWT recoveries
were then summarized in a stock matrix and a fishery matrix to assess
whether there were sufficient raw un-expanded CWTs when summed over all
base period years in each stock/fishery/time step stratum.</p>

paragraph about <a href="#SurFish">surrogate fisheries</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="check-legal" class="section level3">
<h3>1.2 Check Legal</h3>
<p>The calibration program eliminates CWT if a stock/age recovery is not
of legal size. For each stock and age, the calibration program
calculates a proportion legal given the size limit in the fishery. If
the legal proportion given the stock, age, and size limit is zero, the
tag recovery is purged from the data. The program creates a message to
inform the user that there were instances of recoveries for stocks
without a legal population size. The program also creates a summary of
these recoveries in a text file, called “errfile.txt”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="main-calibration-procedures" class="section level2">
<h2>1.3 Main Calibration Procedures</h2>
<p>The purpose of a calibration is to produce base period exploitation
rates for each stock and fishery in the FRAM model. To this end, marked
CWTs from base period years (brood years 2005-2008) were analyzed and
summarized to reconstruct cohorts. At the completion of the base data
development process, each FRAM stock-age cohort is doubled, with half
the cohort being assigned to “unmarked” and the other half to “marked”
components to allow for processing of mark-selective fisheries in
“forward-projection” runs of FRAM used in preseason fishery modeling.
The final step in the calibration cycle is the development of a
completed “base period” input file used by FRAM. This file contains
stock abundances, time-age-fishery specific harvest rates, maturation
rates, growth rates, and various fishery related parameters such as
hooking mortality rates. A new calibration of FRAM is warranted when
there are changes to the input data and/or model structure. Examples
include changes to stocks, fisheries, CWT groups, time structure, and
growth, natural, and fishery related handling mortality rates. All of
these elements influence the estimates of the cohort sizes calculated
during cohort analysis and the corresponding estimates of exploitation
rates.</p>
<p>Cohort reconstruction involves several steps described below and
illustrated by Figure @ref(fig:cal-plot). This process is augmented for
stocks with insufficient CWT recoveries in the existing base period. For
these out-of-base stocks, a different range of years with sufficient CWT
recoveries stands-in to provide the needed tag recovery resolution.
These tag recoveries are adjusted in an iterative process to simulate
the recoveries that would have occurred given the magnitude of the
fisheries in the selected base period (see <a href="#OOB">Out-of-Base
Preocedures</a>). Once adjusted, these CWTs are combined with the
“in-base” recoveries and processed.</p>

<h3><span id="PEFExp">Expand CWTs to Total Production</span></h3>
<p>The purpose of this first step is to estimate the total size of the
stock aggregate by accounting for un-tagged segments of the aggregate;
i.e, the South Puget Sound Chinook stock aggregate is comprised of
tagged Nisqually and Chambers hatchery Chinook, but also includes
untagged Tumwater Falls hatchery and wild Nisqually Fall Chinook. To
make estimates for the entire stock aggregate, the <a
href="#PEF">production expansion factor (PEF)</a> is calculated as the
ratio of adult escapement accounted for with CWTs to the total adult
escapement of a stock.</p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:PEF)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that if a ‘large’ CWT group is used to represent the catch
distribution of a ‘small’ hatchery stock, the expansion factors may be
less than 1.0 (<a href="#MEW1">MEW,2008</a>).</p>

<div id="expand-cwts-to-match-fishery-catch" class="section level3">
<h3><span id="FishExp">Expand CWTs to Match Fishery Catch</span></h3>
<p>Depending on the setting of an input flag, the observed base period
CWT recoveries are adjusted so that the sum across stocks in each

<div id="fishery-model-stock-proportion-msp" class="section level3">
<h3><span id="MSPpn">Fishery Model Stock Proportion (MSP)</span></h3>
<p><a href="#MSP">MSP</a> is the percentage of a fishery accounted for
by stocks in the model. Chinook FRAM does not contain all the stocks
impacted by FRAM fisheries. A portion of the stocks, particularly those
affecting northern fisheries (Alaska, Canada) are missing from the
model. For these fisheries, FRAM assigns a constant proportion of the
catch to non-model stocks. While the calibration is conducted in a
“marked frame of reference”, a FRAM run requires MSPs as a proportion of
the total (marked + unmarked) catch (see <a href="#MSFpara">Mass Marking
and Mark-Selective Fisheries</a> paragraph). For this reason an input
file was created processing CWT recoveries, catches, and escapements in
a “total” frame of reference. Additionally, for the purpose of
calculating exploitation rates in a “marked frame of reference”, MSP is
also needed as the proportion of the marked catch. Tables
<code>BasePeriodCatch</code>@ref(tab:MrkCatch) and
<code>BasePeriodCatch_Tot</code> @ref(tab:TotalCatch) contain model
stock proportions and flags for marked and total (marked + unmarked)
fisheries.</p>
<p>The previous calibration predominantly relied on estimating the MSP
as the proportion of the catch accounted for by CWTs.</p>
<p>Where</p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:BPObsCatchf)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:CWTCatchf)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:ModelRatio)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The landed catch of a stock at age a in a fishery and time step
becomes:</p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:StkFishLanded)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The current calibration only uses the MSP calculation as described in
equation (#eq:ModelRatio) for a few fisheries, because of the high
variance associated with estimating the parameters entering the
calculation of CWTCatch<sub>f,t</sub>. When flagged as “2”, if the MSP
exceeds 100% of the BPObsCatch<sub>f</sub>, the program scales
CWTCatch<sub>s,a,f,t</sub> to sum to 1.</p>
<p>Summary of MSP flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1</strong>: Adjust modeled catch to equal estimated
catch</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2</strong>: Adjust modeled catch to equal estimated catch
if modeled catch exceeds estimated catch</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3</strong>: Use external adjustment</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A flag of “1” is the default setting for all Puget Sound fisheries.
Using this flag will expand CWTs such that the
CWTCatch<sub>s,a,f,t</sub> summed over stocks, ages, and time steps
equals the BPObsCatch<sub>f</sub>.</p>
<p>For many fisheries outside Puget Sound a flag of “3” was used. This
method relies on external estimates of MSP. CWT recoveries are then
adjusted to sum to observed catch times MSP.</p>
<p>Equation @ref(eq:MSP3)</p>
<p></p>
<div id="external-msp-data-sources" class="section level4">
<h4>External MSP Data Sources</h4>
<p>As described above, the MSP can be calculated by the calibration
program. This method was infrequently used due to the high variance
associated with the estimates. The following external approaches were
used depending on availability.</p>
<div id="default-of-100-msp" class="section level5">
<h5>Default of 100% MSP</h5>
<p>All Puget Sound fisheries were assumed to be completely represented
by model stocks. This was also assumed for Georgia Strait net, North
Washington Coast net, and Grays Harbor net. Additionally, the marked
catch in most fisheries was assumed to be completely accounted for by
the hatchery stocks in the model. This was frequently not the case for
unmarked stocks in a fishery, particularly if comprised of difficult to
enumerate wild stocks or stock components. To achieve an MSP of 100%, a
fishery expansion factor was calculated as in equation
(#eq:FishExpansion).</p>

<div id="chinook-technical-committee-ctc-msp" class="section level5">
<h5>Chinook Technical Committee (CTC) MSP</h5>
<p>For some northern fisheries, we used output from the 2014 calibration
(CLB 1402) of the <a href="#PSC">Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC)</a>
Chinook model to calculate fishery model stock proportions. Details of
this calibrationcan can be found in PSC Joint Chinook Technical
Committee reports [TCCHINOOK (15)-1 V1] (<a
href="https://www.psc.org/publications/technical-reports/technical-committee-reports/chinook/"

and <a
href="https://www.psc.org/publications/technical-reports/technical-committee-reports/chinook/">TCCHINOOK
(15)-1 V2</a>. First, for each PSC Chinook Model stock we determined
whether it was represented by FRAM model stocks. Then, for each relevant
PSC Chinook model fishery, we summed the total stock specific catch
across 2007 - 2013 (FRAM base period catch years) based on whether or
not the stock was represented in FRAM. From this we calculated the FRAM
base period fishery model stock proportion by dividing the total catch
of stocks represented in FRAM by the total catch of all stocks.</p>

<h3>Summary of CWT Expansions</h3>
<p>Prior to the <a href="#PEFExp">PEF expansion</a> and the <a
href="#FishExp">fishery expansion</a> described in the last two
paragraph, CWTs are subjected to two other expansions. The first
expansion occurs in <a href="#RMIS">RMIS</a> and is called a sampling
expansion. It is calculated as the total catch in a fishery/time step
divided by the sampled catch in a fishery/time step. This results in the
number of CWTs that would have been recovered if 100% of the fishery had
been sampled. A second expansion, the brood year expansion, is applied
within <a href="#xxx">FRAMBuilder</a> to CWTs that have already received
a sampling expansion. The default method gives equal weight to all brood
years within the model, but users can also specify brood year weights.
The brood year expansion is specific to individual brood years. To
calculate the expansion rate, the total number of tags for each brood
year is summed. The brood year with the largest number of recoveries is
then divided by the sum of tags from the brood year of interest. This
expansion factor is then applied to all the CWT recoveries of the brood
year to be manipulated.</p>
</div>
<div id="backwards-cohort-reconstruction" class="section level3">
<h3>Backwards Cohort Reconstruction</h3>
<p>After all CWT expansions have been applied, Cohort reconstruction
occurs “backwards” such that, for each stock, it begins with age 5
Chinook in the final time step, progressing through descending time
steps and ages with the age 2, time step 1 cohort calculated last.
First, escapement of age 5 Chinook in time step 3 for a given stock is
calculated by summing over escapement CWT recoveries. Note that
escapement recoveries also include recoveries from freshwater fisheries
(see <a href="#xxx">FRAMBuilder</a>). This is used as a starting value
to which terminal fishery mortalities are later added. Total
pre-terminal and terminal mortalities are calculated separately by
looping through every fishery within a time step and adding expanded
CWTs adjusted for other mortality (dropoff/dropout; expressed as a
percentage of catch; found in the <a href="#Inc">IncidentalRate</a>
table of the Calibration Support data base) and by adding sublegal
mortalities (see <a href="#id_#SubRate">sublegal mortality</a> section
below for additional details as to how this is calculated) and Chinook
Non-Retention Mortality (CNR).</p>
