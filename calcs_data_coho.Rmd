# 1. Coho Model Structure

## 1.1. Stocks

Currently, 123 <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Stock" target = "_blank" title = "Stock">stock</a> groups are represented in Coho <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Fishery_Regulation_Assessment_Model_(FRAM)" target = "_blank" title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</a>. Each of these stock groups have both <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Marked" target = "_blank" title = "marked">marked</a> (adipose fin clipped) and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Unmarked" target = "_blank" title = "Unmarked">unmarked</a> components to permit assessment of mark-selective fishery regulations; therefore, the current version of <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> has a total of 246 stock units (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_1_Coho_FRAM_stocks" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 1">Appendix 1</a>).  Model stocks may represent an individual salmon stock or an aggregate of stocks from the same region.  Stock units represented in <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> were chosen based on the level of management interest, their contribution to <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Pacific_Fishery_Management_Council_(PFMC)" target = "_blank" title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</a> fisheries, and the availability of representative coded-wire tag (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Coded-Wire_Tag_(CWT)" target = "_blank" title = "CWT: Coded-wire tag">CWT</a>) recoveries in the Regional Mark Information System (<a title = "RMIS: Regional Mark Information System" href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Regional_Mark_Information_System_(RMIS)" target = "_blank">RMIS</a>).  Coho <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> includes a comprehensive set of stocks originating from Central California to Southeast Alaska and represents total West Coast production. For Coho, only age three fish are included in the model.

## 1.2. Fisheries

The <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> includes <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Pre-terminal_Fishery" target = "_blank" title = "Pre-terminal fishery">pre-terminal</a> and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Terminal_Fishery" target = "_blank" title = "Terminal fishery">terminal fisheries</a> in southeast Alaska, Canada, Puget Sound, and off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California.  There are 198 fisheries in Coho <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. A unique fishery identification number and fishery name for each of the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fisheries are listed in <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_3_Coho_FRAM_fisheries" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 3">Appendix 3</a>. Terminal fisheries in Coho <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> include individual freshwater fisheries. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> can model <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Directed_Fishery" target = "_blank" title = "Directed fishery">directed fisheries</a>, mark-selective fisheries, and non-retention fisheries, and also calculates fisheries-related <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Incidental_Mortality" target = "_blank" title = "Incidental mortality">incidental mortalities</a>. 

## 1.3. Time Steps

The <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Time_Step" target = "_blank" title = "Time step">time step</a> structure used in <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> represents a level of resolution that corresponds to data availability, fishery management structure, and species-specific migration and maturation schedules. Recoveries of <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWTs</span> for each stock unit during years with widespread tagging and fisheries (the reference <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Base_Period" target = "_blank" title = "Base period">base period</a>, explained further in **Section 3**) are used to estimate model <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Parameter" target = "_blank" title = "Parameter">parameters</a> such as exploitation rates. The amount of recovery data available by stock unit and fishery in the historical <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> database limit the time-step resolution of the model.  Decreasing the number of <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> recoveries in a time step by making the time step shorter can increase the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Variance" target = "_blank" title = "Variance">variance</a> of the estimated parameters in those strata.  In recognition of these data limitations, efforts were made to restrict the level of time step resolution to that necessary for life history fishery management purposes.

At each time step, a stock experiences <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Natural_Mortality" target = "_blank" title = "Natural mortality">natural mortality</a>, and can be subjected to pre-terminal fisheries, and terminal fisheries. 

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> contains five time periods for Coho, covering a single calendar year (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_5_Time_step_structure_used_in_Coho_and_Chinook_FRAM_modeling" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 5">Appendix 5</a>).

# 2. Assumptions and Limitations

*Major assumptions and limitations of the model are briefly described below.*

**<span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> fish accurately represent the modeled stock.**  Many <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> stocks are represented by <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWTs</span> from only one production type, usually hatchery origin.  For example, in nearly all cases wild/<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Natural" target = "_blank" title = "Natural">natural</a> stocks were aggregated in the base period with <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Hatchery" target = "_blank" title = "Hatchery">hatchery</a> stocks and both are represented by the hatchery stock’s <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> data.  Therefore it is assumed that the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Tagged" target = "_blank" title = "Tagged">tagged</a> and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Untagged" target = "_blank" title = "Untagged">untagged</a> fish are distributed and exploited at the same rates.

**Each stock unit and age class is exploited as a <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Single_Pool_Model" target = "_blank" title = "Single pool model">single pool</a>.** All pre-terminal fisheries operate on the entire cohort simultaneously in each time step, and all terminal fisheries operate on the mature run.

**Natural mortality only varies by time step and is constant between stocks and from year to year.** 

**Release mortality and drop-off rates are fishery and time step specific and constant between stocks and from year to year.** Note: Mortality rates can be updated, but this is done very infrequently, i.e., only a few rates have been updated in the past 30 years.

**Stock distribution and migration is constant from year to year and is represented by the average distribution of <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> recoveries during the reference base period.**  We currently lack data on the annual variability in distribution and migration patterns of Chinook and coho salmon stocks.  In the absence of such estimates, fishery-specific exploitation rates are computed relative to the entire cohort.

# 3. Model Parameterization

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> data are stored as tables in a Microsoft Access database. All the information needed for a “simple model run” (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/user_basic_forward_run.html" target = "_blank" title = "User Manual: Basic Forward Run">User Manual</a>) is stored in these tables, containing input as well as output data. Input data can be grouped into two main categories: static base period data and annual run data. Main <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> outputs are mortalities (landed, mark-selective, non-retention, drop-off) and abundances (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Starting_Cohort" target = "_blank" title = "Starting cohort">starting cohorts</a> at each time step; abundances after natural mortalities, pre-terminal, and terminal fisheries).

```

## 3.1. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Input Data

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> input data consist of two main input types: base period reference data and annual data.  Base period data remain constant until a new base period replaces the existing one.  The principal base period inputs are stock-fishery-time step specific exploitation rates.  Other base period parameters include base period catches and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Cohort_Size" target = "_blank" title = "Cohort size">cohort sizes</a>.  The second input type consists of annual data that can vary with each model run, such as stock specific abundance estimates, fishery catches, <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Size_Limit" target = "_blank" title = "Size limit">size limits</a>, etc.  

### 3.1.1. Base Period Data

<span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> recoveries are used to estimate model parameters such as time/area/fishery exploitation rates.  The years from which <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> recoveries are used to estimate these parameters are referred to as the reference "base period."  These parameter estimates are derived through stock-specific <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Cohort_Analysis" target = "_blank" title = "Cohort analyses">cohort analyses</a>.  Each cohort analysis is a series of procedures that use <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> recoveries and base period catch and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Escapement" target = "_blank" title = "Escapement">escapement</a> data to “back-calculate,” or reconstruct, a pre-fishing cohort size for each stock using assumed natural mortality and incidental mortality rates.  See (Model Evaluation Workgroup, 2008) for a more detailed description of the cohort analysis procedures.

Model base period data for the Coho <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is derived from fishery and escapement recoveries of <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWTs</span> and terminal area run size estimates for return years 1986-1992 (Packer et al. 2007).  In 2006, the previously used base period data from 1986-1991 were re-analyzed, changes were made to the algorithm, and 1992-1997 catch year data were compiled.  A decision was made to only incorporate the 1992 catch year with the previous base period data, and thus the Coho base period for return years 1986-1992 was generated.

If modeled fishery impacts for a stock deviate significantly from regulatory expectations or an analysis of <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWT</span> data is re-examined, a stock fishery rate scaler can be used for individual stocks within a fishery and time step to deviate from the reference base period. The stock fishery rate scaler is optional, must be agreed-to, and can be tied to an individual annual fishery input or remain as a static input to adjust the reference base period exploitation rate for a stock-fishery-time step.

### 3.1.2. Annual and Semi-static Data

These data are comprised of five general types of input.  Three of these input types (<span title = "a. Cohort abundance; b. Fishery landed catch; d. Mark-selective fisheries">a, b, d</span>) are submitted annually to reflect projected stock abundances and proposed fishery regulations for the current model year.  The remaining two types of input (<span title = "c. Release-mortality rates; e. Other non-landed mortality rates">c, e</span>) are specifications for fishery-related mortalities that can change as more information becomes available through additional data collection or studies, but typically do not change annually.

**a.** *Cohort Abundance*:  For each stock unit, an annual abundance is obtained from a regional expert, typically in the form of an ocean age-3 run size (pre-fishing age-3 abundance in the ocean after natural mortality has been subtracted).  In a <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Pre-season" target = "_blank" title = "Pre-season">pre-season</a> context these abundances come from annual forecasts, whereas in a <a href = https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Post-season" target = "_blank" title = "Post-season">post-season</a> context the abundances are derived from estimates of actual returns. For Coho, an initial stock abundance is needed for adult fish (age-3) by mark status.  

**b.** *Fishery Landed Catch*:  The model provides three options for setting the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Landed_Catch" target = "_blank" title = "Landed catch">catch</a> in a fishery: a <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Quota" target = "_blank" title = "Quota">quota</a>, a <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Fishery_Scaler" target = "_blank" title = "Fishery scaler">fishery scaler</a>, and a <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Harvest_Rate_(HR)" target = "_blank" title = "HR: Harvest rate">harvest rate</a> (for Puget Sound and Washington coastal terminal fisheries). 

<u>Quota</u>:  Catch in the fishery is set equal to a numeric value input by the user.<br>
<u>Fishery Scaler</u>:  The fishery is scaled relative to the effort during the reference base period using a scaler value input by the user. The catch resulting from a scaler is a function of the base period exploitation rates and stock abundances.  
<u>Harvest Rate</u>:  Using the Puget Sound <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Terminal_Area_Management_Module_(TAMM)" target = "_blank" title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</a>, a terminal area harvest rate can be applied to terminal area fisheries (time step 4 and 5). In the Coho <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, the terminal run size definitions can be customized (using the TAAETERSList table in the Microsoft Access database) and must be aligned with calculations used for each model input. For a list of terminal fisheries see <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_3_Coho_FRAM_fisheries" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 3: Coho FRAM fisheries">Appendix 3</a>.

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> inputs for quota and fishery scaler can be identified as either a conventional retention fishery or a mark-selective fishery and modeled accordingly.  Modeling as a mark-selective fishery initiates additional calculations to estimate catches, <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Encounter" target = "_blank" title = "Encounter">encounters</a>, and mortalities differently for marked and unmarked groups.

**c.** *Release Mortality Rates*:  This is the mortality associated with the release of landed fish from hook-and-line and other gear types. Release mortality rates are designated by species, geographic area, fishery type and gear type (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_6_FRAMTAMM_fishery-related_mortality_rates_for_Coho_salmon_(version_used_in_2021_pre-season_planning_models)" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 6">Appendix 6</a>). Release mortality is assessed when Coho are not retained (“non-retention” or <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#ChinookCoho_Non-retention_(CNR)_Fisheries" target = "_blank" title = "CNR: Coho non-retention">CNR fisheries</a>) as well as in mark-selective fisheries. A number of studies have estimated release mortality for hook-and-line fisheries, and release mortality rates for <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Troll_Fishery" target = "_blank" title = "Troll fishery">troll</a> and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Recreational_Fisheries" target = "_blank" title = "Recreational fisheries">recreational fisheries</a> in the ocean have been formally adopted by the <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span>.

Release mortality in the majority of net fisheries with non-retention is estimated externally to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> using agreed-to rates.

**d.** *Mark-selective fisheries* have two additional variations of “release” mortality that are described as either the inappropriate retention of an unmarked fish or the release of a marked fish that consequently experiences release mortality.  The failure to release an unmarked fish is a user input to the model called “<u>Unmarked Retention Error</u>” (<span title = "Unmarked retention error">$ure$</span>, or <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Unmarked_Retention_Error_Rate" target = "_blank" title = "Unmarked retention error rate">Retention Error Rate</a>) and is the proportion of the unmarked fish encountered that are retained.  The release of marked fish is a user input to the model called “<u><a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Marked_Recognition_Error_Rate" target = "_blank" title = "Marked recognition error rate">Marked Recognition Error</a></u>” (<span title = "Marked Recognition Error">$mre$</span>) and it is the proportion of the marked fish encountered that are released; these released marked fish are then subject to release mortality.  These rates are updated annually based on fishery monitoring data. 

**e.** *Other Non-landed Mortality Rates (Incidental Rates)*:  This includes fishing-induced mortality not associated with directly handling fish.  <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Drop-off_Mortality" target = "_blank" title = "Drop-off mortality">Drop-off mortality</a> can occur when fish in sport and troll hook-and-line fisheries drop off the hook before they are brought to the vessel. <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Drop-out_Mortality" target = "_blank" title = "Drop-out mortality">Drop-out mortality</a> occurs when fish in commercial net fisheries are not brought on board but die from injury as a result of encountering the net.  For simplicity, both types are referred to as drop-off mortality in <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>.  Net drop-out mortality rates vary depending on species, net type, or timing (pre-terminal or terminal) of the fishery.  In general, a 5% drop-off mortality rate is applied to the landed catch to account for “other <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Non-landedNon-retention_Mortality" target = "_blakn" title = "Non-landed mortality">non-landed mortalities</a>” in hook-and-line fisheries (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_6_FRAMTAMM_fishery-related_mortality_rates_for_Coho_salmon_(version_used_in_2021_pre-season_planning_models)" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 6">Appendix 6</a>).

## 4.1. Overview

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>  processes information through a time step loop, beginning with time step 1 and ending with time step 5 for Coho.  Within each time step, a series of four computational processes occur for each stock as depicted in Figure 1: (**1**) calculate starting cohort size, (**2**) remove natural mortality, (**3**) remove pre-terminal mortalities, (**4**) remove terminal fishery mortalities (time 5 only).

## 4.2. Computational Processes

In the following equations, variables are presented with origin specific formatting: 

- Variables estimated in FRAM are shown in regular $italics$.
- Variables that are input by a user, including externally estimated values, are shown as <b>bold</b>. 
- Variables that are estimated during the base period are shown with an <u>underline</u>.
- Variables that are estimated using a BkFRAM run are shown as <span style = "color: blue;">blue</span>.

**Cohort Abundance**

<u>Process 1:  Cohort Abundance at the Start of the Time Step</u>

The starting cohort size in time step 1 is a product of two parameters: (*1*) the base period cohort size for stock *s* at age 3 in the first time period (<span title = "Base period cohort abundance estimate of stock s at age 3">$BPCohorts_{s,a \! = \! 3}$</span>) and (*2*) a stock and age-specific scaler (<span title = "Stock recruit scaler of stock s at age 3">$StockScalers_{s,a \! = \! 3}$</span>).

Pre-season, the starting cohort is generally calculated from forecasts of ocean age-3 (<span title = "Ocean Age-3">OA3</span>) abundances. These forecasts are expanded for natural mortalities by multiplying OA3 * 1.2315 to arrive at January age-3 (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#January_Age-3_Abundance_(JA3)" target = "_blank" title = "JA3: January age-3 abundance">JA3</a>) starting cohorts.

Post-season, the starting cohort is generally calculated by expanding escapement estimates for fisheries mortalities and natural mortalities during <span title = "BkFRAM: Backwards FRAM">BkFRAM</span> (see <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_data_coho.html#6_Backwards_FRAM" target = "_blank" title = "Chapter 6: Backwards FRAM">Backwards FRAM</a> chapter).

<p>**(1)**<div style = "text-align:center"><span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step 1">$Cohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t\!=\!1}$</span> $=$ <span title = "Base period abundance of stock s at age 3.
Base period calculation"><u>$BPCohort$</u>$_{s,a \! = \! 3}$</span> $\times$ <span title = "Stock recruit scaler of stock s at age 3.
BkFRAM calculation" style = "color: blue;">$StockScaler$</span>$_{s,a \! = \! 3}$ </div> </p>
where <span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step 1">$Cohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t\!=\!1}$</span> is the initial cohort size for stock *s*, age 3, during time step *t*=1.

Coho <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> only models age-3 fish (*a*=3). The starting cohort size is the projected number of age-3 fish in January (<span title = "JA3: January age-3 fish">JA3</span>) of the fishing year for each stock.  All Coho escape in the final time step (*t*=5) and thus are not aged in the model.

**Natural Mortality**

<u>Process 2: Natural mortality during each time step</u> <br>

During each time step, the stock-age cohort size at the start of the time step is decreased to account for natural mortality:

<p>**(2)** <div style = "text-align:center"><span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step t">$Cohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t}$</span> $=$ <span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step t">$Cohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t}$</span> $\times$ <span title = "Discrete natural mortality rate at age 3 and time step t.
Input by user">$(1-$<b>$M$</b>$_{a \! = \! 3,t})$</span> </div> </p>

where <span title = "Discrete natural mortality rate at age 3 and time step t">$M_{a \! = \! 3,t}$</span> is the discrete natural mortality rate for age 3 fish during time step *t* (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_8_Time_period_and_age-specific_rates_used_by_FRAM_to_simulate_Coho_and_Chinook_natural_mortality" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 8">Appendix 8</a>).

**Pre-terminal Fishery Mortality**

<u>Process 3: Pre-terminal Fishery Mortality</u>

The remaining cohort is then subjected to removals by pre-terminal fisheries; both landed catch and non-landed mortalities associated with each fishery are calculated. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> simulates fishery mortalities using different processes depending upon the type of fishery: retention fishery (non-selective), non-retention fishery, or mark-selective fishery. 

<u>**3a.** In regular retention fisheries (non-selective), landed catch is estimated by:</u>

<p>**(3)**<div style = "text-align:center"><span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t">$Catch_{s,a \! = \! 3,f,t}$</span> $=$ <span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step t">$Cohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t}$</span> $\times$ <span title = "Base period exploitation rate for stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t.
Base period calculation"><u>$BPER$</u>$_{s,a \! = \! 3,f,t}$</span> $\times$ <span title = "Fishery scaler for fishery f during time step t.
Input by user"><b>$FisheryScaler$</b>$_{f,t}$</span> $\times$ <span title = "Portion vulnerable of stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t">$PV_{s,a \! = \! 3,f,t}$</span> $\times$ <span title = "Stock fishery rate scaler for stock s in fishery f during time step t.
Input by user"><b>$SHRF$</b>$_{s,f,t}$</span> </div> </p>

where:

- <span title = "Base period exploitation rate for stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t">$BPER_{s,a \! = \! 3,f,t}$</span> is the base period exploitation rate for stock *s*, at age 3, in fishery *f*, during time step *t*.
- <span title = "Fishery scaler for fishery f during time step t">$FisheryScaler_{f,t}$</span> is an annual model input that relates effort in the model year back to the effort during the base period.
- <span title = "Portion vulnerable of stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t">$PV_{s,a \! = \! 3,f,t}$</span> is the portion of the stock cohort *s*, at age 3, during time step *t* that is of legal size in fishery *f* (i.e. portion vulnerable; <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Proportion_Vulnerable_(PV)" target = "_blank" title = "PV: Proportion vulnerable">PV</a>).

<u>**3c.** Coho non-retention (CNR) mortalities are estimated</u> when fishing is allowed, but the retention of Coho is prohibited.

Non-retention mortalities are calculated external to the model, often derived using historical observations, and are model fishery inputs by time step in units of dead age-3 fish <span title = "Estimated coho non-retention mortalities in fishery f during time step t">$(EstCNRMorts_{f,t})$</span>.

The stock-specific CNR mortality in a fishery and time step is computed in four steps.

Drop-off mortalities in mark-selective fisheries are calculated by multiplying the drop-off mortality rate with the number of total encounters, as described in process 3b above.

<u>**3e.** All pre-terminal fishery mortalities</u> in time step *t* for stock *s* at age 3 are totaled <span title = "TotMort: Total pre-terminal fishery mortalities">$(TotMort)$</span> and the size of the cohort is reduced accordingly. Since the Coho model contains only age-3 mature fish, the summing of fishery mortalities occurs only once in each time step.

Fisheries during time steps 1 through 4 are considered to be on <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Immature" target = "_blank" title = "Immature">immature</a> fish and, by default, all Coho fisheries in time step 5 are on mature fish.  Thus, 
<div style = "text-align:center"><span title = "Mature cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step 5">$MatureCohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t \! = \! 5}$</span> $=$ <span title = "Cohort abundance of stock s at age 3 during time step 5">$Cohort_{s,a \! = \! 3,t \! = \! 5}$</span>. </div>

<u>Process 4: Terminal Fishery Mortality</u>

Terminal fishery mortality is calculated for the mature cohort only, using the same equations as for pre-terminal fishery mortality.  Fishery mortalities are summed, and the remainder of the mature cohort constitutes the escapement from <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fisheries. Since only age-3 adult Coho are modeled and the mature time step is always 5, age and time step parameters can be eliminated from the equations.

Escapement is defined as the number of fish that remain in the mature cohort after removal of all terminal-area fishery related mortality. For coho modeling, which includes freshwater fisheries, escapement represents the adult spawning abundance if mortality during “pre-spawning” holding time is negligible.

<u> Process 5: <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> Iterations</u>

For Coho, traditionally, the word "Terminal" has two meanings. It can either denote fisheries occurring on the mature cohort(see previous paragraph) or it can describe fisheries that occur in terminal marine areas (see <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_appendices.html#Appendix_3_Coho_FRAM_fisheries" target = "_blank" title = "Appendix 3: Coho FRAM fisheries">Appendix 3</a>). These fisheries occur in time step 4 and 5, are reported from <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, and involve iterative solutions to calculate stock specific impacts. During a first pass, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> completes a run with the terminal fishery inputs stored in the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> database. These "seed" inputs usually stem from a previous model run. After this pass is completed, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> estimates terminal fishery impacts using values from <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> and compares them to the original <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> results.  If these numbers are equal (less than 0.1% or fewer than 4 fish difference), the model is done.  If these numbers are not equal, an <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#TAMM_Iterations" target = "_blank" title = "TAMM iterations">iterative</a> process is initiated during which <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> terminal fishery impacts are used to adjust <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> terminal fishery impacts until there is convergence (see <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_data_coho.html#5_Terminal_Area_Management_Module_(TAMM)" target = "_blank" title = "Chapter 5">Chapter 5</a>).  

Finally, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> sends terminal marine and freshwater run sizes and fishing mortality to the <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> file for use in additional calculations and final reporting.

## 4.3. Processing Schematic

To facilitate  understanding of the sequencing of <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> processing steps, Table 3 provides an example of how a stock’s cohort is processed through time step from starting cohort to escapement.

The starting cohort in time step 1 is first reduced by natural mortality. The remaining cohort is vulnerable to pre-terminal fisheries. Coho not caught become the starting cohort of the next time step. This cycle repeats until time step 5, when 100% of Coho mature after pre-terminal fishing.  The mature cohort is susceptible to terminal fisheries. Coho not caught after pre-terminal and terminal fisheries in time step 5, go to escapement.

## 4.4. Exploitation Rate Calculation

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> calculates stock-specific mortalities and escapements that are ultimately used to compute exploitation rates (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Exploitation_Rate_(ER)" target = "_blank" title = "ER: Exploitation rate">ER</a>). Exploitation rate calculations are not part of the main <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> algorithms and are not calculated by <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. Exploitation rates are computed from <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> or <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> output as the sum of all fishery mortalities divided by fishery mortalities plus escapement.

**(15)**

## 4.5. Bias Corrected Mark-Selective Fishery Equations for Coho

Mark-selective fisheries (MSF) allow anglers to keep legal-size, adipose-fin clipped hatchery fish (hereafter, "marked") and require the release of any fish with an adipose fin (hereafter, "unmarked"). Originally, both Chinook and Coho FRAM used estimates of release mortality ($\delta$) and time-period specific exploitation rates (ER) from non-selective fisheries as a surrogate for encounter rates of unmarked stocks to estimate the mortality of unmarked fish (equations **9a** and **9b**).

<p> (**16**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $SimpleExploitationRate_{Unmarked} = ER$ $\times$ <b>$\delta$</b> </div> </p>

Chinook FRAM continues to rely on this method. However, the release of salmon causes bias in these linear exploitation rate calculations. The true mortality for unmarked fish is underestimated because it is an increasing function of time-period specific encounter rates. The unmarked-to-marked ratio of all fish in the pool increases over time as the result of selective removal of marked fish in MSFs and released unmarked fish that survive may encounter the fishing gear more than once during the time period (Figure 2). The original linear functions do not capture this process. Additionally, because all fisheries during a modeled time period are assumed to operate simultaneously on a single pool of fish, this bias also occurs in any modeled non-selective fisheries (NSF) that take place during the same model time period as the MSF.

```{r msfbiasimage1, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/MSFbiasFig1.PNG"))
```

**Figure 2**: During MSF, the selective removal of marked fish (black) may increase the unmarked-to-marked ratio. In this example, the mark rate is 50% at the start of the time-period and 25% at the end. Additionally, released unmarked fish that survive encountering the fishing gear (light blue) may encounter the fishing gear again. In this example, two fish (dark blue), encountered gear again and were thus subjected to release mortality more than once, plus two additional unmarked fish encounters (light blue) occurred.

***Bias Corrected Mark-Selective Fishery Calculations for Coho***

The *biased* exploitation rate for a stock in a mark-selective fishery, shown in red, is simply the time-period-specific average exploitation rate from the base period multiplied by a scalar that relates the expected current year effort to the base period effort and a release mortality rate for the fishery.

To simplify calculations, the $SHRF$, $mre$, and $ure$ were excluded from the calculations below:

<p> (**17**) <div style = "text-align:center"> <span style = "color: red;">$ER$</span>$_{Marked} =$ <b>$FisheryScaler$</b> $\times$ <span title = "Base period exploitation rate for stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t.
Base period calculation"><u>$BPER$</u></span> $\times 1$ </div> </p>

<p> (**18**) <div style = "text-align:center"> <span style = "color: red;">$ER$</span>$_{Unmarked} =$ <b>$FisheryScaler$</b> $\times$ <span title = "Base period exploitation rate for stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t.
Base period calculation"><u>$BPER$</u></span> $\times$ <b>$\delta$</b>  </div> </p>

In the original biased equations, the exploitation rates of non-selective fisheries were the same as the marked exploitation rate ($ER_{Marked}$) in mark-selective fisheries. Subsequent unbiased equations were developed with a marked frame of reference. In the following equations, $ER_{Marked}$ is synonymous with the original non-selective exploitation rates.

The equations above are biased as they approximate a nonlinear Baranov equation with a linear model. Conrad, Hagen-Breaux, and Yuen (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_citations.html" title = "Conrad et. al 2013">2013</a>) developed unbiased calculations for the number of unmarked mortalities when there are multiple MSF and NSF acting on a stock in a time period. This paper is summarized briefly here, see the publication for more detailed documentation. 

When the only fishery acting on a stock in a time period is a MSF, the unbiased method for calculating the total unmarked exploitation rate is:

<p> (**19**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{ER}$$_{Unmarked} =$ $1 - (1 - ER_{Marked})$ <b>$^ \delta$</b>, </div> </p>

and $\delta$ is the release mortality rate of the fishery.

This becomes more complicated when there are multiple fisheries acting on an unmarked cohort during the same time period. Even when assuming a constant release mortality across all fisheries, because of nonlinearity it is not correct to perform bias corrections separately on each fishery and then sum over all fisheries. This incorrect method results in the underestimation of the true exploitation rate on the unmarked cohort. When there are multiple fisheries acting on a stock in a single pool model, and the release mortality is constant across all fisheries, the total bias-corrected exploitation rate on the unmarked cohort across all fisheries is calculated as:

<p> (**20**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{ER}$$_{Unmarked, F} =$ $1 - (1 -$ $\sum_f^F$${ER_{Marked,f}})$ <b>$^ \delta$</b>, </div> </p>

where $f$ is an individual fishery and $F$ is the set of all fisheries.

In reality, in any given time period many stocks are subject to a mixture of NSF and MSF with varying release mortality rates, and mark-recognition is not perfect. Recognition errors for marked fish ($mre$, probability that a marked fish is released) reduce the exploitation rate on the marked cohort and introduce bias in the exploitation rate calculation for the marked portion of the stock. Conversely, recognition errors for unmarked fish in MSF ($ure$, unmarked fish are kept) increase the exploitation rate on an unmarked cohort.

An overall release mortality rate in fishery $f$ that accounts for mark-recognition error for a marked cohort ($\delta_{Marked,f}$) is defined by:

<p> (**21**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\delta_{Marked,f}$ $=$ $mre_f$ $\times$ <b>$\delta$</b>$_f$ $+$ $(1$ $-$ $mre_f)$ </div> </p>

Similarly, for the unmarked cohort:

<p> (**22**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\delta_{Unmarked,f}$ $=$ $(1$ $-$ $ure_f)$ $\times$ <b>$\delta$</b>$_f$ $+ ure_f$ </div> </p>

Because of mark recognition error, weighted release mortality rates ($\delta^W$) across all fisheries in the modeled time period are calculated for marked and unmarked cohorts. These weighted release mortality rates are the ratio of the sum of the biased exploitation rate calculations, which account for release mortalities and the sum of the marked exploitation rates.

Weighted release mortalities for marked and unmarked are calculated as:

(**23**)
$$\delta^{W}_{Marked} = \sum^{F}_{f}(\frac{ER_{Marked,f} \times \delta_{Marked,f}}{\sum^{F}_{f} ER_{Marked, f}}) = \sum^{F}_{f}(\frac{ER_{Marked,f} \times \{ mre_f \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f + (1 - mre_f)\}}{\sum^{F}_{f} ER_{Marked,f}})$$

(**24**)
$$\delta^{W}_{Unmarked} = 
\sum^{F}_{f}(\frac{ER_{Marked,f} \times \delta_{Unmarked,f}}{\sum^{F}_{f} ER_{Marked, f}}) =
\sum^{F}_{f}(\frac{ER_{Marked,f} \times \{ (1 - ure_f) \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f + ure_f ) \}}{\sum^{F}_{f} ER_{Marked,f}})$$

If there is no mark recognition error, bias-adjusted exploitation rates for marked and unmarked stock units are calculated as:

<p> (**25**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{ER}_{Marked, F} = \sum_{f}^{F} ER_{Marked,f}$ </div> </p>

<p> (**26**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{ER}_{Unmarked,F} = 1 - (1 - \sum_{f}^{F} ER_{Marked,f})^{\delta^{W}_{Unmarked}}$ </div> </p>

If there is mark recognition error, bias-adjusted exploitation rates for marked and unmarked stock units are calculated as:

<p> (**27**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{ER}_{Marked,F} = 1 - (1 - \sum_{f}^{F} ER_{Marked,f})^{\delta^{W}_{Marked}}$ </div> </p>

<p> (**28**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{ER}_{Unmarked,F} = 1 - (1 - \widehat{ER}_{Marked,F})^{\delta^{W}_{Marked} / \delta^{W}_{Unmarked}}$ </div> </p>

Once unbiased exploitation rate calculations are completed, the total number of unmarked and marked mortalities that are projected to occur in all fisheries are allocated to each fishery in each time period. The unbiased total mortalities ($\widehat D$) are allocated proportional to the simple, biased exploitation rate of each fishery. This total is calculated as:

<p> (**29**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{D}_{Unmarked,f} = N_{Unmarked} \times \widehat{ER}_{Unmarked,F} \times P_f$ </div> </p>

Here, $N_{Unmarked}$ is the initial number of unmarked fish after natural mortality and $P_f$ is the proportion of total unmarked fish mortalities in all fisheries that occurred in fishery $f$.

<p> (**30**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $P_f = \frac{ER_{Marked} \times \delta_{Unmarked,f}}{\sum_{f}^{F} ER_{Marked} \times \delta_{Unmarked,f}}$ </div> </p>

A similar process can be used to allocate marked mortalities to fisheries.

After total mortalities for a fishery have been calculated, they are assigned as catch ($L$) and non-landed mortalities ($N$) using recognition rates and release mortalities.

For an unmarked cohort, landed catch for fishery $i$ ($\widehat D_{L, Unmarked, f}$) is calculated:

<p> (**31**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{D}_{L, Unmarked, f} = \widehat D_{Unmarked,f} \times \frac{ure_f}{(1-ure_f) \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f + ure_f}$ </div> </p>

and non-landed mortality ($\widehat D_{N, Unmarked, f}$) is calculated as:

<p> (**32**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat{D}_{N, Unmarked, f} = \widehat D_{Unmarked,f} \times \frac{(1 - ure_f) \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f}{(1-ure_f)  \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f + ure_f}$ </div> </p>

Similarly, for a marked cohort:

<p> (**33**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat D_{L, Marked, f} = \widehat D_{Marked,f} \times \frac{(1 - mre_f)}{mre_f \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f + (1 - mre_f) }$ </div> </p>

and non-landed mortality ($\widehat D_{N,Marked,f}$) is calculated as:

<p> (**34**) <div style = "text-align:center"> $\widehat D_{N,Marked,f} = \widehat D_{Marked,f} \times \frac{mre_f \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f}{mre_f  \times \boldsymbol{\delta}_f + (1 - mre_f)}$ </div> </p>

***Applying MSF Bias Calculations to FRAM***

If MSF are modeled as rates in FRAM, the equations presented above work well. These equations are rate based and incorporate fishery effort scalers to model the magnitude of fisheries. However, many fisheries are modeled as quotas with a catch input; in essence supplying the results, expected mortalities, of the unbiased equations. The model has to find the fishery effort scaler that produces these results utilizing the unbiased equations. This problem cannot be corrected at a stock level, since the catch of a fishery is made up of many stocks. The unbiased exploitation rates can be found using an empirical, iterative solution. First, the unbiased exploitation rates are calculated using base period exploitation rates ($FisheryScaler$ = 1), then the landed catch of marked and unmarked fish is calculated ($Catch$). This landed catch is compared to the target catch. A new fishery effort scaler is computed as $FisheryScaler = TargetCatch/Catch$. Iterations continue until the calculated FRAM landed catch matches the quota.

```
**Figure 3**: Flowchart illustrates the iterative process of calculating unbiased exploitation rates when a MSF is modeled as a quota.

If you would like to see the exact steps completed in FRAM (as shown in Figure 3), read on. Otherwise, stop here. All steps are completed for each stock. 

Step 1: Calculate unbiased marked ($\widehat{ER}_{Marked,s,f,t}$) and unmarked ($\widehat{ER}_{Marked,s,f,t}$) exploitation rate for stock $s$ in time period $t$ using equations **27** and **28** ($FisheryScaler = 1$). During the first iteration, $ER_{Marked,s,f,t}$ $=$ <span title = "Base period exploitation rate for stock s at age 3 in fishery f during time step t.
Base period calculation"><u>$BPER$</u>$_{s,f,t}$</span>.

Step 2: Calculate total landed catch of marked ($D_{Marked,L,s,f,t}$) and unmarked ($D_{Unmarked,L,s,f,t}$) cohorts of stock $s$ using equations **31** and **33**.

Step 3: Calculate total landed catch across all stocks encountered in a fishery.

$$Catch_f = \sum_s{D_{Marked,L,s,f,t}} + \sum_s{D_{Unmarked,L,s,f,t}}$$

Step 4: Calculate fishery scaler.

$$FisheryScaler_f = \frac{TargetCatch_f}{Catch_f}$$

Step 5: Scale base period exploitation rate.

<div style = "text-align:center"> 
$ER_{Marked,s,f} = FisheryScaler_f \times$ <span title = "Base period exploitation rate for stock s at age 3 in fishery f.
Base period calculation"><u>$BPER$</u>$_{s,f}$</span>
</div>

These steps are repeated until $Catch_f$ is equal to the target quota.

# 5. Terminal Area Management Module (<span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>)

The <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> program interacts with the <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, a species-specific Microsoft Excel file, which allows users to specify alternative terminal fishery inputs and to calculate impacts on a finer level of resolution than <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM.</span> The <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> has separate sections for each of the six Puget Sound terminal regions defined in the Puget Sound Salmon Management Plan (PSSP 1985, Table 3) for the State of Washington and the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Treaty_Tribes" target = "_blank" title = "Treaty Tribes">Washington Treaty Indian Tribes of Puget Sound</a>, as well as Washington coastal terminal regions. This structure has supported development of unique regional management goals and allows managers the flexibility to analyze and report <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model output according to their needs.

<span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> is best understood in its historic context as a terminal-area-centric fisheries model. Prior to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> development, information of stock-specific fishery impacts was not readily available. At that time, management was based on terminal run reconstructions that assigned 100% of terminal catches to only local terminal stocks. However, in the current model framework, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> takes <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> fishery inputs and accounts for non-local and local stock impacts before reporting stock-specific impacts back to <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>. Additionally, the <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> also conducts alternative modeling for Washington coastal Coho stocks in terminal area fisheries, as well as generating inputs for Columbia River models.

Harvest rates are multiplied by a unique terminal run size definition (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Terminal_Run_Size" target = "_blank" title = "TRS: Terminal run size">TRS</a>).  The <span title = "TRS: Terminal run size">TRS</span> for a <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> region/stock represents ‘run-to-the-river’ of a stock plus catches of all stocks in the terminal fisheries designated for that region.

# 6. Backwards <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>

Backwards <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Backwards_FRAM_(BkFRAM)" target = "_blank" title = "Backwards FRAM">(BkFRAM)</a> is a utility that determines <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> starting cohorts when estimates of escapements  and fishery catches (landed and non-retention) are provided.  The program iteratively adjusts stock recruit scalers (a surrogate for starting cohorts, see equation below) and runs <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> forward until the resulting escapements match the target escapements. Starting cohorts are in units of January-age-3 adult fish. 

Post-season <span title = "bkFRAM: backwards FRAM">BkFRAM</span> runs are generally conducted to create the starting cohorts that result in observed escapements given known fishery catches. These cohorts are needed to calculate post-season exploitation rates.  

Working backwards from time step 5 to time step 1, for each time step, fishery and natural mortalities of a stock are added to the escapement target. Total mortalities are calculated by summing landed, drop-off, and non-retention mortalities over all fisheries for a stock and time step.
 
<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Mark_Selective_Fishing_Bias" target = "_blank" title = "Mark-selective fishing bias">Mark-selective fishery bias</a> correction calculations used for Coho produce an error when the exploitation rate exceeds 100%.  This frequently occurs during early iterations, because the abundances from the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Seed_Run" target = "_blank" title = "Seed run">seed run</a> (usually the pre-season run) are not related to the post-season fishery catches (e.g., low pre-season forecasts but high post-season terminal catches).  To avoid errors, the first iteration initiates starting cohorts scaled 1000 times greater than the base period abundance.  Additionally, the first 7 iterations are run without bias correction to get sufficiently close to the target escapement, before adding mark-selective fishing bias calculations for all remaining iterations.
