An update to the FRAM base period (BP) for Chinook salmon was used in the pre-season planning process in 2017. Ongoing QAQC has subsequently addressed various data revisions and errors. 

Prior to this work by the Puget Sound comanagers, the Chinook BP drew on data from the 1974-79 brood years, observed in fishing calendar years 1979-84. The revised BP utilizes data from 2005-2008 brood years in fishing calendar years 2007-2013. The update was undertaken to provide a more recent representation of the distribution of stocks and structure of fisheries.
