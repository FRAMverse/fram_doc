*Terms are defined in the context of the FRAM model.*

# **Abundance Forecast**
Annually developed, stock-specific predictions of returning Chinook and Coho salmon.

# **Adult Equivalent (AEQ)**
The potential for a Chinook of a given age to contribute to the mature run (spawning escapement) in the absence of fishing.  Because of natural mortality and unaccounted losses, not all unharvested fish contribute to spawning escapement. 

# **Backwards FRAM (BkFRAM)**
A utility within the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model that calculates starting abundances when provided with estimates of catches and escapements.

# **Base Period**
A range of years from which <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> data are used to estimate exploitation rates and other parameters through a process of cohort reconstruction. Resulting base period reference parameters are used to populate the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model to predict annual stock/fishery specific impacts.

# **Calibration**
Process creating base period exploitation rates by first selecting <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> groups to represent <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> stocks and then reconstructing the cohort. Once cohort sizes are established, stock/age/fishery/time step specific exploitation rates are computed.

# **Cape Falcon**
Cape in Northern Oregon defining an important <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> fishery management boundary (45&deg;46'00"N).

# **Chinook/Coho Non-retention (CNR) Fisheries**
Fisheries where salmon fishing is allowed, but the retention of Chinook or Coho salmon is prohibited. Impacts in non-retention fisheries are calculated as encounters times release mortality.

# **Coded-Wire Tag (CWT)**
Coded micro-wire implanted in juvenile salmon prior to release.  When recovered, the binary code on the tag identifies the tag group, and thus provides information such as location and timing of release, special hatchery treatments, etc.

# **Cohort Analysis**

# **Deterministic Model**
A model predicting the outcome without estimates of variance.

# **Discrete Model**
A model dealing with objects that can assume only distinct, separated values.

# **Drop-off Mortality**
Mortality of salmon that are lost from sport or troll hook-and-line type fishing gear before they are landed and die from their injuries prior to harvest or spawning.

# **Drop-out Mortality**
Mortality of salmon that die in a fishing net prior to harvest or salmon that disentangle from a net while in the water and die from their injuries prior to harvest or spawning.  Referred to in this <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> documentation under the umbrella term of drop-off mortality.

# **Encounter**

# **Exploitation Rate (ER)**
When used to refer to model output, represents the total fishing mortality rate, calculated as the sum of all fishery-related mortalities divided by that sum plus escapement. Exploitation rates are <u>stock specific</u>.

The Fishery Regulation Assessment Model is a simulation model developed for fishery management and used to estimate the impacts of proposed Pacific Coast salmon fisheries on Chinook and Coho stocks of interest to fishery managers.

# **Fishery Scaler**
A multiplier, typically based on expected fishery effort or catch relative to base period effort or catch, used to estimate fishery impacts by adjusting the base period exploitation rates. 

# **Harvest Rate (HR)**
Catch or total fishing mortality in a fishery expressed as a proportion of the total fish abundance available in a given fishing area. Harvest rates are area specific. The catch is the total catch of all stocks in an area. Harvest rates are most often used for terminal fisheries, where the rate represents the terminal catch divided by the terminal abundance.

When <span title = "MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSFs</span> operate during a modeled time step, mortalities are underestimated because released fish may encounter the fishing gear more than once during the modeled time step.

# **Marked Recognition Error Rate**

# **Marked**
A Chinook or Coho that had its adipose fin removed; commonly a visual identifier of a hatchery fish that can be retained in a mark-selective fishery.

# **Natural Mortality**
All mortality not resulting directly or indirectly from fisheries, including death resulting from predation, illness, malnutrition, lethal environmental conditions, etc.

A group of fish of the same species. There is no distinct single definition for stocks in <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>.
