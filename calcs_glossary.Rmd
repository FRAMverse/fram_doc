*Terms are defined in the context of the FRAM model.*

# **Abundance Forecast**
Annually developed, stock-specific predictions of returning Chinook and coho salmon.

# **Adult Equivalent (AEQ)**
The potential for a Chinook of a given age to contribute to the mature run (spawning escapement) in the absence of fishing.  Because of natural mortality and unaccounted losses, not all unharvested fish contribute to spawning escapement. 

# **Backwards FRAM (BkFRAM)**
A utility within the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model that calculates starting abundances when provided with estimates of catches and escapements.

# **Base Period**
A range of (brood-)years from which <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> data are used to estimate exploitation rates and other parameters through a process of cohort reconstruction. Resulting base period parameters are used to populate the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> model to predict annual stock/fishery specific impacts.

# **Calibration**
Process creating base period exploitation rates by first selecting <span title = "CWT: Coded wire tag">CWT</span> groups to represent <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> stocks and then reconstructing the cohort. Once cohort sizes are established, stock/age/fishery/time step specific exploitation rates are computed.

# **Cape Falcon**
Cape in Northern Oregon defining an important <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> fishery management boundary.

# **Chinook/Coho Non-retention (CNR) Fisheries**
Fisheries where salmon fishing is allowed, but the retention of Chinook or coho salmon is prohibited. 

# **Coded-Wire Tag (CWT)**

A fishery which directly targets a species or subgroup, i.e., hatchery or natural, as opposed to an incidental fishery that impacts a species/sub-group as a by-product of having a different target (bycatch).

# **Discrete Model**
A model dealing with objects that can assume only distinct, separated values. Whereas discrete objects can often be characterized by integers, continuous objects require real numbers.

# **Drop-off Mortality**
Mortality of salmon that are lost from sport or troll hook-and-line type fishing gear before they are landed and die from their injuries prior to harvest or spawning.  Also, the general term refers to both drop-off and drop-out mortality in this <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> documentation.

# **Drop-out Mortality**
Mortality of salmon that die in a fishing net prior to harvest or salmon that disentangle from a net while it is in the water and die from their injuries prior to harvest or spawning.  Referred to in this <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> documentation under the umbrella term of drop-off mortality.

Exploitation rate bias caused when using linear equations with parameters derived from retention fisheries to estimate mortalities in fisheries where all or  part of the encounters are released. When <span title = "MSF: Mark-selective fishery">MSFs</span> operate during a modeled time step, mortalities are underestimated because released fish may encounter the fishing gear more than once during the modeled time step.

# **Marked Recognition Error Rate**
