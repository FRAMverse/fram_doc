<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is used by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Pacific_Fishery_Management_Council_(PFMC)" target = "_blank" title = "PFMC: Pacific Fisheries Management Council">PFMC</a>), Washington salmon <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Terminal_Area_Management_Module_(TAMM)" target = "_blank" title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</a> are shared, discussed, and agreed-to by salmon <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Co-managers" target = "_blank" title = "Co-managers">co-managers</a> (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; Western Washington Treaty Indian Tribes), and the Pacific Salmon Commission (coho only) to estimate the annual impacts of proposed or completed ocean and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Terminal_Fishery" target = "_blank" title = "Terminal fishery">terminal fisheries</a> on Chinook and coho salmon stocks.  The Chinook version evaluates impacts on most stock groups originating from the California Central Valley (Sacramento River), north-central Oregon coast, Columbia River, Willapa Bay, north Washington coast, Puget Sound, and southern British Columbia.  The coho version evaluates impacts on a comprehensive set of stocks originating from Central California to Southeast Alaska and is considered to represent total West Coast production. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> results are used to examine the impacts of proposed fisheries within a single management year for compliance with management objectives, allocation arrangements, Endangered Species Act (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Endangered_Species_Act_(ESA)" target = "_blank" title = "ESA: Endangered species act">ESA</a>) requirements, and domestic and international legal obligations.

Various <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> outputs inform the compliance of proposed fisheries with conservation and management objectives.

This site includes technical background information and a user guide focused on running the <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> application, modifying model inputs, and obtaining and interpreting model outputs.

# 2. Background {-}

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is a <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Deterministic_Model" target = "_blank" title = "Deterministic model">deterministic</a>, <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Discrete_Model" target = "_blank" title = "Discrete model">discrete</a>, time-age structured model designed to aid planning of Chinook and Coho salmon fisheries. It is designed to address the effects of multiple mixed-stock fisheries on individual stocks, each further stratified by age and mark status (and possibly <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Hatchery" target = "_blank" title = "Hatchery">hatchery</a> origin). The model calculates fishery related mortality, including catches and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Non-landedNon-retention_Mortality" target = "_blank" title = "Non-landed mortality">non-landed</a> impacts, imposed on the abundance of each stock unit.

In a given yearly run, over the course of several <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Time_Step" target = "_blank" title = "Time step">time steps</a>, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> allocates a mixed stock cohort to catches, non-retention mortality and <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Escapement" target = "_blank" title = "Escapement">escapement</a> (for Coho) or escapement to the terminal area (for Chinook). This occurs by combining forecasted or observed stock run sizes and fishery practices with <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Parameter" target = "_blank" title = "Parameter">parameters</a> <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Calibration" target = "_blank" target = "Calibration">calibrated</a> from observations made during a fixed "<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Base_Period" target = "_blank" title = "Base period">base period</a>" set of baseline years. The base period integrates fishery catches, stock age and mark composition information, and coded wire tag (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Coded-Wire_Tag_(CWT)" target = "_blank" title = "CWT: Coded-wire tag">CWT</a>) recovery data to produce a calibrated reference pattern of stock distributions and stock-specific <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Harvest_Rate_(HR)" target = "_blank" title = "HR: Harvest rate">harvest rates</a> by time-step and fishery. 

A fundamental element of <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> calculations are the stock-age-fishery-timestep specific exploitation rates (defined as the total mortality divided by abundance, itself the sum of mortality and escapement). This expression of catch as a proportion of the available abundance is based primarily on coded wire tag release and recovery data from the Regional Mark Information System (<a href="https://www.rmis.org//rmis_login.php?action=Login&system=cwt" target="_blank">RMIS</a>). The Chinook base period was recently updated with <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWTs</span> from catch years 2007 – 2013 (brood years 2005 – 2008), and has continued to see revision with ongoing data quality improvements. The Coho base period is comprised of <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWTs</span> from catch years 1986 – 1992.

# 3. History {-}

<span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is an empirically fit tool that uses the past to inform a representation of the future. Over time, algorithms have been added or adapted to capture changing management options, and the development platform of the application has evolved, but the basic structure remains much the same as when it was conceived in the late 1970’s. 

In the mid-1970s, <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Treaty_Fisheries" target = "_blank" title = "Treaty fishery">treaty fishery</a> rights litigation, and the associated legal obligation for the states of Washington and Oregon to provide <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Treaty_Tribes" target = "_blank" title = "Treaty Tribes">Treaty Tribes</a> with the opportunity to harvest specific shares of individual runs, introduced a need for a quantitative tool to project the impact of proposed salmon fisheries at the stock-specific level. Other legal issues, such as the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Magnuson-Stevens_Fishery_Conservation_and_Management_Act" target = "_blank" title = "Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act">Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act</a> and the <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Law_of_the_Sea_Convention" target = "_blank" title = "Law of the Sea Convention">Law of the Seas convention</a>, contributed to the need to improve assessment tools. These considerations provided the impetus to develop early salmon fishery assessment models using the information available from the coast wide <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWT</span> program.

In the late 1970s, the Washington Department of Fisheries (WDF) and U.S. National Bureau of Standards (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#US_National_Bureau_of_Standards" target = "_blank" title = "NBS: U.S. National Bureau of Standards">NBS</a>) developed a model for evaluating alternative fishery regulatory packages that was coded in FORTRAN and ran on a mainframe computer at the University of Washington. The <span title = "WDF: Washington Department of Fisheries">WDF</span>/<span title = "NBS: U.S. National Bureau of Standard">NBS</span> Model could be configured for either Chinook or Coho by using different input data files. This <span title = "WDF: Washington Department of Fisheries">WDF</span>/<span title = "NBS: U.S. National Bureau of Standard">NBS</span> model was not extensively used by the <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> because it proved costly to operate and results were difficult to obtain in a timely manner.  Morishima and Henry (2000) provide a more in-depth history of Pacific Northwest salmon management and fishery modeling.

In the early 1980s, the development of personal computers allowed for the <span title = "WDF: Washington Department of Fisheries">WDF</span>/<span title = "NBS: U.S. National Bureau of Standard">NBS</span> model to be converted into simple spreadsheet models. This transformation improved accessibility to the model during the <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> preseason planning processes. The first spreadsheet model for Chinook used by the <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> was developed in the mid-1980s to model Columbia River “tule” fall Chinook. The corresponding spreadsheet model for Coho, the Coho Assessment Model (CAM), covered stocks from the Columbia River, Puget Sound, and Washington and Oregon coastal areas. The <span title = "CAM: Coho Assessment Model">CAM</span> was revised over time, principally to improve report generation capabilities and provide more detailed information for managing terminal area fisheries in Puget Sound using Terminal Area Management Modules (TAMMs). The <span title = "CAM: Coho Assessment Model">CAM</span> was used as the primary model for evaluating Coho impacts for proposed <span title = "PFMC: Pacific Fishery Management Council">PFMC</span> fisheries until the mid-1990s.

The increased complexity of proposed fishery regulation regimes, along with the need for increased time and spatial resolution for impact projections, soon surpassed the capability of the spreadsheet models. In the mid-1990s, CAM was programmed in QUICK BASIC and renamed <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. The recognition that common algorithms underlie both the Coho and Chinook spreadsheet models led to the effort to develop the QUICK BASIC version of <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> for both species. The <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> code could be used to evaluate proposed fishery regulation regimes for either Chinook or Coho by using different input file configurations. In 1998, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> was converted to VISUAL BASIC to take advantage of the improved user interface available through the MS-WINDOWS operating system. A multi-agency Model Evaluation Subgroup periodically reviewed model performance and parameter estimation methods and coordinated revisions to the model during this period (1998-2000).

A new version of <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> was introduced in 2012. It was coded by James Packer (<span title = "WDFW: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife">WDFW</span>) in VISUAL STUDIO.NET and uses an MS Access database rather than binary text files for data storage and retrieval.  In 2017, additional software changes were implemented when an updated Chinook base period was adopted using brood year 2005-2008 <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWTs</span>. Substantial changes were made to the calibration programs, modeling of <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Sublegal" target = "_blank" title = "Sublegal">sublegal</a> <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Encounter" target = "_blank" title = "Encounter">encounters</a>, growth estimation, <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Impute" target = "_blank" title = "Impute">imputing</a> <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWT</span> recoveries for stocks and fisheries with few or no <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWTs</span>, handling <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Mark-selective_Fishery_(MSF)" target = "_blank" title = "MSF: Mark-selective fishery">mark-selective fisheries</a>, and developing <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Model-Stock_Proportion_(MSP)" target = "_blank" title = "MSP: Model-stock proportion">model stock proportions</a>.

Although some program subroutines are shared, Chinook and Coho are processed separately, with distinct time step divisions, stocks, and fisheries. The Chinook version evaluates impacts on most stock groups originating from the California Central Valley (Sacramento River), north-central Oregon coast, Columbia River, Washington coast, Puget Sound, and Southern British Columbia. However, not all stocks along the West Coast of North America are represented in Chinook <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. Some of the stocks that are not represented in Chinook <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> include any stock in California except Sacramento Falls, Oregon stocks originating south of Elk River, Mid and Upriver Columbia River Springs, Snake River Springs, and Canadian stocks originating north of Georgia Strait. The Coho version evaluates impacts on a comprehensive set of stocks originating from Central California to Southeast Alaska and is considered to represent total West Coast production.

# 4. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Interactions with Other Models {-}

```{r FRAM models interaction flow chart image, echo=FALSE}

```

Figure 1. Simplified interactions between the Base Period, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, and <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> (<a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Terminal_Run_Size" target = "_blank" title = "TRS: Terminal run size">TRS</a>: Terminal Run Size, BPER: Base Period Exploitation Rates)

## 4.1. <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> {-}

In addition to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, the modeling of fishery impacts for Puget Sound Chinook stock units requires a <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>. When <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> is run without <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, it will be missing *accurate* estimates for terminal and freshwater fisheries. The Chinook <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> passes stock and fishery inputs to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>. Subsequently, <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> modeling returns output to the <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span>, which then performs additional calculations before generating reports. The Coho <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> functions to pass Puget Sound fishery inputs to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span>, to perform additional calculations for Washington coastal and Columbia River fisheries/stocks, and to generate reports from <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> output. Thus, the use of both <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> and <span title = "TAMM: Terminal Area Management Module">TAMM</span> is generally necessary for both Chinook and Coho modeling.

## 4.2. <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> Base Peiod {-}

The <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> base period is developed by summarizing coded-wire-tag information from <a title = "RMIS: Regional Mark Information System" href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Regional_Mark_Information_System_(RMIS)" target = "_blank">RMIS</a> from a continuous time period with a sufficient number of <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWT</span> releases and recoveries. The current base period uses brood year releases from 2005-2008 for Chinook and 1986-1992 for coho. A calibration program written in VisualBasic.net maps the <span title = "CWT: Coded Wire Tag">CWTs</span> to <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> fisheries, stocks, and time steps and conducts a cohort reconstruction to estimate exploitation rates and other parameters, such as base period <a href = "https://framverse.github.io/fram_doc/calcs_glossary.html#Cohort_Size" target = "_blank" title = "Cohort size">cohort sizes</a>. These estimates form the basis of a <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> run and remain static between model runs. Using these base period parameters allows <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> to predict the stock composition, exploitation rates, and escapements of future fisheries when provided with forecasts of abundance and fishery mortalities.

# 5. Coho vs Chinook Differences {-}

While there is only one <span title = "FRAM: Fishery Regulation Assessment Model">FRAM</span> program that handles both Chinook and Coho model runs and many of the core processes and algorithms are identical, this document presents the model and computational structures independently for each species.  This decision was made in an effort to improve readability and clarity, as there are a variety of unique features specific to each species that can be difficult to differentiate when they are presented together.
