The Fishery Regulation Assessment Model (FRAM) is an accounting tool for estimating the impacts of proposed fisheries on [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_salmon) and [Coho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon) salmon stocks during a fishing season. FRAM is a computer program developed and used by:

 - the Pacific Fishery Management Council [(PFMC)](https://www.pcouncil.org/salmon/background/), 
 - Washington State, as coordinated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife [(WDFW)](https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing), 
 - Washington Treaty Tribes and their supporting organization Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission [(NWIFC)](https://nwifc.org/), 
 - the Pacific Salmon Commission (Coho only) [(PSC)](https://www.psc.org/),
 - and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service [(NMFS)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/).

Various FRAM outputs inform the compliance of proposed fisheries with conservation and management objectives.

This site includes technical background information and a user guide focused on running the FRAM application, modifying model inputs, and obtaining and interpreting model outputs.
