After launching FRAM and continuing past the startup splash screen, the main menu organizes the available functionality. Below are links to sections that correspond to different main menu items as well as descriptions of some of the primary files associated with preparing and conducting runs.

```{r main_menu, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fvs_main_menu.png")
```

 - **Open Database** is the first step to using FRAM, opening a file selection window to choose a [Project database]
 - **FRAM Version Changes** opens a window with summary text descriptions of the present and past versions
 - **Select Model Run** allows the choice of a particular model run and associated parameters from the [Project database];^[after the required initial selection when opening the database, re-selection is needed after some utilities and database changes made outside of FRAM in addition to simply switching among different runs]
 - **FRAM [Utilities]** opens a secondary menu of tools for managing files and runs
 - **[Edit Model Run]** opens a secondary menu with options to alter stock and fishery parameters for the currently selected run
 - **[Save Model Run Inputs]** ensures that changes to values in memory are written to the appropriate [Project database tables]
 - **[Run Model]** triggers the calculation of outputs given the current parameter values and conditioned on several final choices
 - **Post Season Run** initiates the process of a [Backwards FRAM] run (not necessarily during the post-season) that uses catch and terminal abundance to reconstruct pre-fishing cohorts 
 - **Output/Results** opens a secondary menu allowing selection of various [Outputs] following model run completion 
 - **Exit** closes the program
